This directory contains an efficient implementation of Paice's stemmer.
If you have trouble setting up the Berkeley DB to use the stem classes of
Jeremy Pickens, I advise you to use Paice's stemmer (Porter's and Lovins'
have been extensively tested along with Paice's; the latter seems to work 
better in the task of automatic segmentation).

Contact the authors if you have any question regarding the code
contained in this directory:
 - Written by Chris Campbell, November 1993.
 - Modified by C. Fox, 7/30/98

The code was downloaded from:
http://www.cs.jmu.edu/common/projects/Stemming

I made a few modifications to the original code; they appear in the 
*.diff files.
