-------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.7

- Cleaned up c++-src/Env.mak
- Switched from CVS to Subversion.

-------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.6

- Re-wrote lcseg.pl (renamed 'segment'); minor bug fixes.
- The path to the database file is no longer hard-coded
  inside the binary (if you move LCseg around, you just
  need to modify the path inside the Perl script).
- Ability to segment more than one document per execution, e.g.:
    
	./bin/segment file1 file2 file3

  produces file1.tsegs file2.tsegs file3.tsegs.
  
- A FAQ is now available in the root directory.
- bin/segment wastes less time pre-processing documents 
  (bin/removeseg and bin/cleanup are now part of the Perl script).
  This means that execution on thousands of small documents
  is much faster now (see FAQ).
- Less problems with shared libraries: bin/segment now looks for
  them in the sharedlibs directory.
- With the '-t' flag, 'segment' runs as TextTiling (Hearst, 94). 

-------------------------------------------------------------

Version 1.5

- Minor bug fixes.
- Support for gcc/g++ version 4.0.
- LCseg is no longer distributed with Solaris binaries,
  though it should continue to compile fine on Solaris 
  machines.

-------------------------------------------------------------

Version 1.4

- Minor bug fixes.
- LCseg provides an API to run LCseg from other c/c++ programs 
  (compile your programs with c++-src/liblcseg.a).

-------------------------------------------------------------

Version 1.3

- First public release.
