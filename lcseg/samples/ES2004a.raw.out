hmm hmm hmm .
are we we're not allowed to dim the lights so people can see that a bit better ?
yeah .
okay , that's fine .
am i supposed to be standing up there ?
so we've got both of these clipped on ?
okay .
==========
she gonna answer me or not ?
yeah , i've got
right , both of them , okay .
yes .
god .
jesus , it's gonna fall off .
okay .
yep , yep .
okay .
okay .
hello everybody .
==========
um i'm sarah , the project manager and this is our first meeting , surprisingly enough .
okay , this is our agenda , um
tu tu tu tu
hi , good morning .
we will do some stuff , get to know each other a bit better to feel more comfortable with each other .
um then we'll go do tool training , talk about the project plan , discuss our own ideas and everything um and we've got twenty five minutes to do that , as far as i can understand .
now , we're developing a remote control which you probably already know .
um , we want it to be original , something that's uh people haven't thought of , that's not out in the shops , um , trendy , appealing to a wide market , but you know , not a hunk of metal , and user-friendly , grannies to kids , maybe even pooches should be able to use it .
okay , um , first is the functional design , um this is where we all go off and do our individual work , um what needs need to be fulfilled by the product , um what effects the product has to have and how it's actually going to do that .
um , conceptual design ,
what we're thinking , how it's gonna go and then the detailed design , how we're actually gonna put it into practice and make it work .
'kay .
okay , right .
we're gonna practice with the pens and draw our favourite animal on the white board , i'll go first , and um sum up the characteristics of that animal .
so
oops .
okay , i'll leave space for everyone else .
um
what's missing ?
==========
we're running out of blue .
okay .
i'm not gonna ask you to guess , i'm going to tell you that's supposed to be a tiger .
mm .
and i see them as majestic ,
oh sorry .
mm-hmm .
and independent ,
and
proud .
now , who would like to go next ?
'kay .
yeah , me .
cat .
where did this come from ?
is that your lapel then ?
there you go .
uh , yep .
thank you .
uh , maybe you can guess what i'm trying to make ?
a kind of dog ?
yep .
it's actually sitting , so it's sitting , it's not standing .
okay , i see it as one thing it's very supportive .
sorry ?
it's sitting down .
uh .
it's your best friend and your you can talk to a dog , it can be your best friend , it doesn't discriminate between you , based on what you are .
second it's loyal and third thing it's got intuition .
dogs can som sometimes can make out between a thief and a person so basically these are the three unique features i think belong to a dog .
thank you .
mm-hmm .
okay , thank you .
yeah i'll have a go .
okay .
sorry .
please , please leave me a space at the bottom , i'm little , you can get to the top , with standing on a chair .
thanks .
alright , okay .
well since you guys have chosen the ones i wanted to do , i'll have to have to go for something a bit random .
does it look like a dog actually ?
okay .
and also , my drawing skill isn't that great so , yeah .
well , as you can see , the quality of the work today is um
mm .
i think it's outstandingly good .
==========
okay , now i'm gonna have to change what is was originally gonna be because that looks like a beak now , so .
yeah , it can be a crocodile , it can be a crocodile .
well it was it was an at first firstly it was an attempt at a t_ rex and then it sort of changed into a pelican but it can be a crocodile now actually .
crocodile ?
gonna be a bird .
is it gonna be it's gonna be a bird .
o
that's lovely .
beauti that's
yeah and uh i'll have to think on the spot of uh things that it is .
um
uh scary ,
uh strong ,
yeah that's about it i think .
okay it's fine .
okay .
um , i'm very impressed with your artistic skills , mine's are dreadful .
oops this is now coming apart , let me just put the top in .
uh uh
wo
i hope that clicks in , i'll just i'll hold it on , okay .
oops , oh dear , what happened there ?
technical help .
hmm .
hopefully that'll stay on , two-handed version .
okay , uh
okay .
again this is off the top of my head , i was gonna do a big cat too , um .
uh
oh dear , it doesn't look what like what i want it to be .
hmm .
s
uh .
uh
it's not a vampire bat honestly .
okay , yeah .
uh and somewhere there's a body behind .
==========
that's my dreadful that's the worst yet , that's it's meant to be an eagle you can tell it's a flying animal could have been a seagull , i never thought of a seagull .
an eagle , um again i'm thinking on my feet goodness .
i suppose they're all so independent , i'd put that one down again .
da dum um .
okay , some sort of bird .
a seagu right , not a seagull .
eagle , okay .
ah eagle , right okay .
they're good at golf .
indepen independent , right , did you say they're good at golf ?
are they ?
oh .
oh right , okay , i'm not good at golf .
i'd say they're quite free-spirited , flying around everywhere , doing their own thing .
eagle .
yeah , no yeah , an eagle .
and uh , birds of prey aren't they , oh dear , intrepid .
==========
i'll put that , intrepid .
mm-hmm .
there we go , hope that pen's gonna be okay .
that's lovely .
whoops .
okay .
that was fun , right .
um finance-wise , we've got a selling price at twenty five euros , which i don't actually know what that is in pounds , at all .
any ideas ?
it's about mm , mm yeah .
seventeen .
one point four or something like that .
one point four euro would make a pound or something like that .
yeah , yeah , something like that , so that yeah about seventeen , seventeen pounds , something like that .
yeah .
d fifteen ?
seventeen .
okay , that's expensive .
seventeen pounds .
should we be making notes of this ?
we can just refer to this later can't we ?
yeah , okay .
but
i think so , i think so , i'll be able to um pull it up , or i could put it in the shared folder or something .
okay .
havi having said that though , if you wanna get one of those the the ones on the market at the moment they're s they're about twenty pounds anyway .
so , it'd still be yeah , we had to buy one .
right .
really ?
so
mm .
so i suppose later it depends if we want to undercut the price , we d or or is it going to make our product look a cheapie-cheapie option ?
i think
yeah , um production cost's at twelve fifty , so
hmm .
okay , pretty huge margin .
half of the selling price is taken up by building it .
um , and profit aim is fifty million euros , which is uh
yeah .
mm .
mm-hmm .
in our first year ?
yi yes , um yeah , i presume so .
um
mm-hmm .
so then
you've got market range international and you did say earlier it's got to be a um accessible and usable by sort of all age groups just t we're not focusing on business market , any particular thing , it's everyone user-friendly to everyone .
okay .
mm-hmm .
no , yeah .
big target group .
so yes , yes , i don't think we have to i don't think it's a case of worrying about different languages and things like that , um making that a key point , just that it's going to be in the international market like australia , america , things like that .
okay .
no .
mm .
what are your experiences with remote controls ?
i mean i've got we got um we had three videos , a t_v_ and a sort of amp thing all set up so we got one of the universal remote controls , um that you programme each of your things into , but that kept losing the signals so we'd have to re-programme it every now and again .
i think it was quite a cheapie as well , so that might have had something to do with it , but that was quite good , the fact that you could
mm-hmm .
yeah .
yeah .
yeah , that c
alright .
yeah uh .
mm-hmm .
use all the ones at the same time .
you didn't have six remote controls sitting in front of you .
right .
okay , you wanna integrate everything into one like
yeah , 'cause you
mm-hmm .
my experience has only been being given the remote control with the object i buy , not doing any tampering with it and programming , using it to programme t_v_ and uh uh videos and things .
but basically on , off , volume up and down , channel one , two , th that basic functions , i don't think i could go any further with it than that , so , i suppose it's got to be something usable by someone like me as well .
okay .
mm .
yeah , the main that's the main stuff anyway , i mean and you don't want to i hate i hate looking at a control and seeing a million tiny little buttons with tiny little words saying what they all do and just sitting there searching for the teletext button or something like that .
mm-hmm .
mm .
yeah .
mm .
and symbols that you don't necessarily understand , symbols you're meant to understand that you don't .
yeah .
um .
so simplification of symbols you could think of .
when they're when you've got the main things on the front of it and a section opens up or something to the other functions where you can do sound or options kind of recording , things like that inside it .
'cause it doesn't make when you pick it up it doesn't make it really complicated to look at , it's obvious what you're doing , um .
oh yeah .
mm-hmm .
mm .
mm-hmm .
mm .
actually that just raises a point , i wonder what our design people think , but you know on a mobile phone , you can press a key and it gives you a menu , it's got a menu display , i wonder if incorporating that into the design of a remote control might be useful , so you've got a little l_c_d_ display .
mm-hmm .
menu , alright .
yeah .
uh uh
right , i was thinking on the same lines you , instead of having too many b buttons and make it complicated for the user , may h maybe have an l_c_d_ di display or something like that , like a mobile , yeah and with menus .
and if it's s somewhat similar to what you have on mobile phone , people might find it easier to browse and navigate also maybe .
with menus , yeah , yeah .
yeah .
what about the older generation ?
what about granny and grandads ?
you mean to save it lesser number .
um , my grandad can answer his mobile phone , but he couldn't even dream of texting or something like that .
yeah .
mm-hmm .
mm-hmm .
can he programme his remote control or is it basic with that too ?
right .
i don't think they tape things , i don't think they use
yeah , my grandad's actually better than me at using teletext , so .
right .
right .
so that's a problem regardless of of any design modifications you you come up with , that's gonna be a problem anyway with the older generation perhaps , and that's another issue how we tackle that .
yeah .
mm , yeah , the age gap .
yeah , what it just needs to be as long as it's sort of self-intuitive and you can can work out
what everything's doing , 'cause i mean , menus on sort of new phones now they've sort of got all these pictures and stuff which makes it fairly obvious what you're trying to do .
mm .
mm-hmm .
but i don't know how
i don't know , i d i don't like the , you know the new phones that have kind of got a windows-based running system .
oh yeah .
mm-hmm .
i find it really confusing , i kept getting lost in the phone , i di i've not got a new one but uh my friend got a new one and i was trying to do things with it and i just kept getting lost , but
right .
that's just me .
yeah , i don't i don't know how for twenty fi , or twelve euros fifty how much of a excellent screen you could get , you'd you'd have to sort of keep it down to a black and white l_c_d_ thing anyway , i'd assume .
yeah .
mm-hmm .
is it possible that that for the older generation you could have like an extra button that you press for large print like you do in large print books ?
obviously it displays less on the screen , it displays less on the screen but as long as they can read it that's the main thing .
okay .
teletext has got that option as well .
yeah .
or what about kind of a dual function ?
in that you've got the basic buttons just for your play , volume , programme things and also and then a menu to go into with obvious pictures , obvious symbols and that's where you control recording and things like that .
mm-hmm .
yeah .
mm-hmm .
mm .
the other thing is , just ch chucking into mobile phone f design features again , it could have a flip top remote control so that when you flip over the top , your screen is you can have a bigger screen in the the flip over .
mm-hmm .
mm , okay .
s
i think that's a cost thing , i don't i don't know how much we're gonna know about
y
it might it might save a b bit of space , it's i instead of looking bulky , it might look small .
but it might have its cost implications .
yeah ?
mm-hmm .
yes , no that's important .
yeah , like smaller .
yeah .
okay .
and there's no reason we need to make it look as fashionable and stylish as a mobile phone , it can still be lightweight plastic , you know ?
something that's easily moulded and produced .
sorry i'm treading on your territory guys .
mm .
right .
yeah .
no uh uh
um , right , okay we've got half an hour before the next meeting , so we're all gonna go off and do our individual things .
um
i think that's probably about it and then we'll come back and liaise again and i get to do another fantastic powerpoint presentation .
yeah .
just just a quick thing about the um about what you're saying about the uh does does it need to be fashionable ?
the sort of i i had a quick look at the company website and it's like the the uh we put the fashion into electronics , so i think think the whole design thing might be qui i mean you don't you you can still have plastic and it'd look quite good but
==========
sure .
ah right .
okay .
okay .
okay .
sure b y yeah .
but yeah , i mean it doesn't have to be that , you know th that was my main point , we don't have to use metal , i don't know if using plastic does make it cheaper , i presume it would .
yeah , yeah , yeah .
yeah .
mm .
yeah .
yeah .
i would it would probably .
i mean there's sky remote controls and everything .
they're kind of moulded and look a bit different , and the telewest remote controls are silver plastic , which looks a bit smarter , so yeah i guess that's stuff we can think about .
==========
okay , so let's break it up there .
right .
okay .
'kay .
okay ?
so , see you in half an hour .
okay .
==========
do we go back to our room ?
yep ?
i think so , yeah .
mm , yeah .
