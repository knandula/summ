A shooter opened fire at a New Jersey mall Monday night, sending panic through the shopping center and setting off a frenzied hunt for the gunman.
No one was injured by the shooting at Westfield Garden State Plaza Mall, Paramus Mayor Rich LaBarbiera said. But no one knew exactly where the gunman was.
The mayor said authorities believe the shooter had left the mall, but New Jersey State Police said they are still searching for the gunman in the building.

McCartney also reveals that his long-bitter relationship with Lennon's widow Yoko Ono has turned a corner.
Describing Ono as a "badass," he says he's moved on. 
"I thought, 'If John loved her, there's got to be something. 
He's not stupid,'" McCartney says. 
"It's like, what are you going to do? Are you going to hold a grudge you never really had?"
