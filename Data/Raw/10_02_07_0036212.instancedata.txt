	<htmltext>For those wondering how wild colors and stripes on ships would hide them from U-Boats -- it didn't.  It made it hard for the U-Boat captains to properly evaluate their targets.  The colors and pattern would disrupt the length, angle, and speed clues seen though binoculars at a distance, and through the periscope when preparing to fire torpedoes.
<br> <br>
Radar didn't exist during WWI, so U-Boats cruised on the surface with lookouts who could eyeball ships or ship smoke at 10 miles, maybe 20 on a good day.  Given their <a href="http://techcenter.davidson.k12.nc.us/Group9/seawar.htm" title="k12.nc.us">15-18 knot surface speed</a> [k12.nc.us] and 6-8 knot submerged speed, the U-Boat now had only 30 minutes or so to get into proper position ahead of the approaching ship -- about 4000-6000 yards (2-3 nautical miles) ahead and to one side of the approaching target.  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\_of\_torpedoes" title="wikipedia.org">WWI German torpedoes</a> [wikipedia.org] could travel 6600 yards at 36 knots, for a max run time of just over 5 minutes.  A target ship moving at 12 knots would move 400 yards in a minute.  A 600 foot ship travels it's length in only 30 seconds.  It's this tiny window that the Razzle-Dazzle would screw up.  If the U-Boat captain guessed wrong on the ships movement due to painted false bow waves and extra bow/stern lines, the firing solution would be bad.
<br> <br>
Remember that the ship view from the U-Boat was usually against cloudy skies of some sort in the North Atlantic.  Add in the blue haze with distance, and the yellows, purples, and pinks start to blur into the background blue-gray sky.  Now think of that sight through a wet periscope a few feet above the water, and you get the idea.
<br> <br>
WWII had a brilliant camoufalge example in the bizarre sounding <a href="http://www.airplane-pictures.net/image8237.html" title="airplane-pictures.net">Pink Spitfires</a> [airplane-pictures.net] used for <a href="http://www.ipmsstockholm.org/magazine/2006/05/stuff\_eng\_profile\_pr\_spitfires.htm" title="ipmsstockholm.org">reconnaissance</a> [ipmsstockholm.org].  The pink shade was selected to blend against the just-past-sunset twilight sky and clouds when those aircraft flew, and it was very effective.</htmltext>
