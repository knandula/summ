Earlier research had suggested that Mars had a warm and wet early history but that between 4 billion and 3.8 billion years ago, before the Hesperian Epoch, the planet lost most of its atmosphere and became cold and dry. In the new study, the researchers analysed detailed images from NASA&rsquo;s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, which is currently circling the red planet, and concluded that there were later episodes where Mars experienced warm and wet periods."</i></htmltext>

	<htmltext>That is what they are. Educated guesses. The scientist gets some information and builds a consensus on a rough time frame. They could be off by a million years but close enough when you are talking billion years. Carbon dating probably couldn't work either because of the differences in atmosphere. It would be cool to send humans to Mars to say we did it and bring back tangible proof like we did for the moon in the 60's. NASA has been wasting alot of money on the shuttle these days and needs to get the next vehicle ready now. Relying on the Russians to transit to and from the ISS is inexcusable for this country. Then on to the moon and build a station on the moon. At first unmanned but eventually setup to be manned like we currently do with the ISS. The only issues would be meteor strikes or significant failure that would prevent astronauts from escaping if there was a life threatening issue.</htmltext>

	<htmltext>FTFA:<p><div class="quote"><p>The researchers determined the age of the lakes by counting crater impacts, a method originally developed by NASA scientists to determine the age of geological features on the moon. More craters around a geological feature indicate that an area is older than a region with fewer meteorite impacts. In the study, the scientists counted more than 35,000 crater impacts in the region around the lakes, and determined that the lakes formed approximately three billion years ago. The scientists are unsure how long the warm and wet periods lasted during the Hesperian epoch or how long the lakes sustained liquid water in them.</p></div><p>So to answer your question the moon is the reference point.

It has large error bars, but it's the best we have until we can send radiometric dating to these areas. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crater\_counting" title="wikipedia.org">Crater Counting</a> [wikipedia.org]]</p></div>

<tokenext>FTFA : The researchers determined the age of the lakes by counting crater impacts , a method originally developed by NASA scientists to determine the age of geological features on the moon .
More craters around a geological feature indicate that an area is older than a region with fewer meteorite impacts .
In the study , the scientists counted more than 35,000 crater impacts in the region around the lakes , and determined that the lakes formed approximately three billion years ago .
The scientists are unsure how long the warm and wet periods lasted during the Hesperian epoch or how long the lakes sustained liquid water in them.So to answer your question the moon is the reference point .
It has large error bars , but it 's the best we have until we can send radiometric dating to these areas .
