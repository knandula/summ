	<htmltext><p>6-12 months is usually for an upgrade (a short one, CERN is calling it an engineering shutdown). A typical shutdown is 1-3 months depending on lab. For comparison sake a typical shutdown is 6 weeks every year at FNAL (that's sort of an average over many years, there have been 3 month shutdowns and two years between them in cases). At SPring-8 they run a typical workday (not 24/7) and have some down time each night and tend to have shutdowns last 4 weeks after two years. They don't really do upgrades, FNAL had one in the era of the tevatron. An upgrade tends to have a different new run afterward and tends to be at least 18 months, often 2 years or more. I thought that CERN was going to do another run after the upgrade at higher energy. They were originally planning on a long upgrade beginning at the end of 2012. Last I heard that got moved-up 6 months or so. It's not a big deal, it always happens that shutdowns get moved around. There is a delicate balancing act where you need to give people enough time to prepare but not go so long that things start breaking. Shutdowns and upgrades are VERY busy times.</p></htmltext>

<sentencetext>It may be due to semantics, but the headline is still inappropriate.
I interpreted "shut down" as "dismantling," as if it were used in "shut down the NASA space program.
" The summary clarifies the issue without sadisticly making you RTFA for it, but the heart attack has already happened.Well, news sources normally do this.
It's just important to remember to never take anything as real unless you've read it AND cross referenced it thoroughly.
