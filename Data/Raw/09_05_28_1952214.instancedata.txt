	<title>Hackers Breached US Army Servers</title>

	<htmltext>An anonymous reader writes <i>"A Turkish hacking ring has <a href="http://www.informationweek.com/news/government/federal/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=217700619">broken into 2 sensitive US Army servers</a>, according to a new investigation uncovered by InformationWeek. The hackers, who go by the name 'm0sted' and are based in Turkey, penetrated servers at the Army's McAlester Ammunition Plant in Oklahoma in January. Users attempting to access the site were redirected to a page featuring a climate-change protest. In Sept, 2007, the hackers breached Army Corps of Engineers servers. That hack sent users to a page containing anti-American and anti-Israeli rhetoric. The hackers used simple SQL Server injection techniques to gain access. That's troubling because it shows a major Army security lapse, and also the ability to bypass supposedly sophisticated Defense Department tools and procedures designed to prevent such breaches."</i></htmltext>

<sentencetext>I do agree that fighting hacker is guerilla warfare that our government is not capable of fighting and for them the fight cannot be won.
They don't underdstand that tatics and most of their cool toys don't work against an enemy such has this.
On two points you are tottaly wrong.
We are winning in Iraq by ending the use of civilians as shields.Yes we ended the use of civilians as shields.
We ended this by changing the term "Civilians" to "Enemy Combatants".
No matter what "term" you use to call them the people we are killing is the local population.
You can call them Enemy Combatants but it doesn't change the fact they are women and children.We won in Vietnam by separating the combatants from the civilians.Dude  we lost that stupid war!
I know I was there!
The reason we lost was we could not separate the combatants from the civilians because the Combatants WERE!
the civilians!
No one except the poloticat eliete wanted us their.
They are a happy thriving peaceful country now that we are gone.The one thing the US Military has yet to figure out is you can win a war against an "Army" but you cannot win a war against a "People" except by completely wiping them out.
Yes and you must kill them all.
If you leave a few they have babies and then you have a bunch of pissed off Grand kids in a few hundred years.
Ask any American Indian.
After over 500 years they still give the US Government a headache.Please as a Vietnam Vet I ask you to not ever make the statement again that we won that fucking war.
We didn't.
I lost a lot of good friends for nothing except to make a few people rich.

Do you have any idea just how many computers have .mil addresses ?
If somebody screwed up on the configuration for an infinitesimally small percentage of them , that 's still a lot of systems open to attack .
And the script kiddies will get lucky.But the US military also does n't talk about their own " cyber " offensive and defensive capabilities for obvious reasons .
Which leads to the erroneous presumption that such capabilities do n't exist.Besides , these kinds of stories are great for getting additional funding for somebody 's pet project .
Much like Kennedy 's complaining about the " Missile Gap " when he beat Nixon .
No such gap existed , but it let Kennedy spend a lot of money fixing the gap .</tokentext>

	<htmltext>I completely agree.  All of my SQL variables are escaped IMMEDIATELY before the executed code.  This way, you can look at any SQL code I've written and instantly know if it's secure or not.  I would call this code "obviously secure" (at least the SQL part is).  It may still contain bugs, but SQL injection won't be possible.


I've seen several other safety mechanisms that escape any variables before sending them to SQL-related functions, but looking inside the function (instead of the caller) you really don't know what data you have and whether it is safe or not.


I think secure code should be obviously secure.  Of course there are those buffer overflow problems and threading etc like you mention, but how about quit using sprintf and instead use snprintf?  WTF?  And don't give me that "If I know I'm just printing a simple variable and I know how long it is, then it's OK" crap either.  Ever seen a calculator come up with a wrong answer that was really close?  Like 3.99897876 instead of 4?  I have.  And we all know that there have been widely-used CPUs with math processor errors.  If your code isn't obviously secure, I argue that it's not secure.  Especially if you aren't the only developer in the pipeline.  We all organize this code differently in our own heads and what makes sense to one dev is confusing to another.  If the code is obviously secure, most of that is eliminated anyways.</htmltext>

I really hope not.

But this so called cyberwarfare that previous posters are talking about that requires outlandish budgets because it's supposedly more dangerous than real warfare is only dangerous when you link weapons to computers. And here we are sitting on top of tens of thousands of nuclear bombs controlled by computers, and building airplanes and tanks and robots with guns. It doesn't matter if they're linked to the internet or not. The fact remains they have radio receivers that can give commands to shoot and kill people.
