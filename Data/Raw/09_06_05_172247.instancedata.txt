	<htmltext><blockquote><div><p> <i>Could you pelase show us your proof that chimp/ape/human don't share a common ancestor ?</i></p></div> </blockquote><p> Wow, good argument there. Let's see, lets assume that you don't believe me when I say the was light is green at the intersection exactly 25 years 1 day, 13 minutes and 2 seconds ago, now prove to me it wasn't. You see how that seems ridiculous? The problem isn't finding proof one way or another, it's how convincing that proof is and how much it ties the truth of the situation to reality. Obviously, there are people who aren't convinced that A happened, the answer is to find more proof that A is true as stated not to have someone who doesn't agree run out and find why A is not true.

<tokenext>Could you pelase show us your proof that chimp/ape/human do n't share a common ancestor ?
Wow , good argument there .
Let 's see , lets assume that you do n't believe me when I say the was light is green at the intersection exactly 25 years 1 day , 13 minutes and 2 seconds ago , now prove to me it was n't .
