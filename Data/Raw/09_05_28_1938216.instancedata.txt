	<htmltext><p>Well, as is always the case in these matters, you have to consider what would need be done to fix the problem.

There are people who *hate* anybody who has the temerity to work for them as a public employee, and they'll go beserk when they see state government ballooning.   They have some sound points as well.   A larger headcount means that it is more complex and painful to tighten the fiscal belt during hard times.   Rather than not letting as many contracts, you've got to let *people* go.</p><p>The other thing is that you've got to grade the positions you hire very high if you want to hire *experienced* people.   One of the things you give up, if you are a public employee drawing a pension, is the right to collect Social Security.  You don't even get your contributions back.  So if you hire a guy who's been paying into Social Security for fifteen years, you've got to pay him enough to make up for his future retirement losses.  Or, you have to restrict yourselves to inexperienced hires, or hires that have worked their entire career in public service, which makes growing the corps of experienced IT people difficult.</p><p>So all told, this might be better than the alternative.  You pay more than low bid, but you get free systems analysis.  The alternative to is to increase head count in a way that will be extremely disruptive to deal with if you want to reduce it later.   You can shit on the public employees later, of course, but that doesn't get you *efficient* government.  It gets you government run by employees looking to get some of their own back.
