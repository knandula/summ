	<htmltext>A recent post at the Press Start To Drink blog examined <a href="http://pressstarttodrink.blogspot.com/2009/11/cease-and-desist-games-culture-and.html">the relationship the games industry has with copyright laws</a>.  More so than in some other creative industries, the reactions of game companies to derivative works are widely varied and often unpredictable, ranging anywhere from active support to situations like the <a href="https://games.slashdot.org/story/09/05/12/0643208/Square-Enix-Shuts-Down-Fan-Made-Chrono-Trigger-Sequel"> <em>Chrono Trigger: Crimson Echoes</em> debacle</a>. Quoting:
<i>"... even within the gaming industry, there is a tension between IP holders and fan producers/poachers. Some companies, such as Epic and Square Enix, remain incredibly protective of their Intellectual Property, threatening those that use their creations, even for non-profit, cultural reasons, with legal suits. Other companies, like Valve, seem to, if not embrace, at least tolerate, and perhaps even tacitly encourage this kind of fan engagement with their work. Lessig suggests, 'The opportunity to create and transform becomes weakened in a world in which creation requires permission and creativity must check with a lawyer.' Indeed, the more developers and publishers that take up Valve's position, the more creativity and innovation will emerge out of video game fan communities, already known for their intense fandom and desire to add to, alter, and re-imagine their favorite gaming universes."</i></htmltext>

<tokenext>Intellectual property is a bankrupt and indefensible notion.I am not so sure about this .
If I spend many hours thinking of very novel and original way of doing something useful , should I not be able to live off the resulting earnings for a while before the person who did not invest any time in the idea can just copy it and undercut me ?
Since they did not have to invest the time in its invention , their costs will be lower so I can not compete on that basis.In my ideal world I would freely share all my ideas for the good of mankind , but unfortunately the good of mankind does not pay for a roof over my head and put food in my belly .
Until it does I want to be able to do something I enjoy and earn money for it , since this beats earning money for doing something I hate.Many people often answer this with the service argument , but this does not always work .
Some things simply do not suit the software as a service model , especially computer games since many people are resistant to pay for play.I can not help but think that until we have abandoned the concept of money , then we will always have to allow a certain level of IP protection to someone who invents something original .
So the real debate should maybe become about how much IP protection there should be and how long it should last.And as a final note , I am just going to rehash one of Richard Stallmans recent points : That the whole GPL and open source concept relies on copyright law .

	<htmltext>The war between open and closed source has coalesced in the gaming community. Take Infinity Ward vs Steam for example. Both have great games; however one allows for open source utilization and private dedicated hosting, while the other has recently chosen to horde their source code and even the rights to multiplayer dedicated hosting. You would not think that these two giants would be conspiring, especially with both of their track records in the gaming community, but I have drawn some dangerous conclusions for the entire gaming community in my mind about such things:

We must examine the recent developments to come to this insane conclusion of mine: Both corporate giants Infinity Ward and Steam have sold out to each other: <a href="http://www.gamepolitics.com/2009/11/06/non-steam-digital-deliverers-uninterested-selling-mw2" title="gamepolitics.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.gamepolitics.com/2009/11/06/non-steam-digital-deliverers-uninterested-selling-mw2</a> [gamepolitics.com] You can&rsquo;t play Call of Duty:Modern Warfare 2 without steam on the PC version, and at the same time Infinity Ward has decided to not allow the PC version to have private dedicated servers! This is a dangerous leap towards PC gaming prioritization, all in the name of &ldquo;keeping the PC on a level playing field with consoles&rdquo;. How many more people will buy into the amazing DRM abilities of Steam and then lock every open source aspect of their game? Will Valve follow suit?


I fear that there is an inevitable slow prioritization happening in the PC gaming world. For once the PC world becomes as DRM restricted as efficiently as the console world, both console and PC gamers will be screwed in quality, hosting, and pricing. I do not believe that anything good can come from this new trend seen emerge with the Steam/Infinity Ward convergence with the CoD:MW2 release. Unless PC gamers are able to restrict themselves from supporting these colossal game giants to protest their move to not allow things like their disabled dedicated server capabilities, we will be allowing these companies to succumb to the inevitable greed that will prosper in this world of PC gaming prioritization. The scary part is Infinity Ward is apart of Activision, and Activision is apart of Blizzard. You can see how the conspiracies can fly off the handle from here.</htmltext>

	<htmltext>I can understand square/enix, the developers of this "fan-sequel" tried to get fame for doing another chrono trigger.
Chrono Trigger is a brand, it was probably the most famous rpg on the snes.
Square build up this brand, why should they let somebody else make use of it?
The creators of the chrono sequel could have also made their own rpg, but probably noone would care, so they make a rpg in the chrono trigger scenario, so they get world famous for doing the chronotrigger sequel.
You know if you want to make a game related to a film, like batman, you also need to pay the licence holders of batman money, for creating a game with the tag "batman".
And above else this game could also be a bad game and would damage the brand then, which would lead to less income for square, which square needs to be able to exist.</htmltext>

<sentencetext>I was reading about a series of Japanese games called the Touhou project a few weeks back.
What was interesting is that while the single author of the franchise enforces his copyright to the games themselves, he doesn't on the characters and settings that games revolves around.This has allowed many groups to create works (primary comics, but also remixed music and other things) based off his work.
He doesn't mind people even selling these things.
All they're required to do, is to make sure that they state they're not an original work.This has made him and his franchise surprising successful, but it seems he is now worried that it'll grow beyond his control.
After a project announced that they would produce an short animated film with some well known voice actors, he ranted in his blog that about it.
Some people would argue that Touhou is currently better known for the community's work rather then the creator's original work, and unless he starts really enforcing his copyright, this may not change.
On the other hand, if he did that, it would also kill off most his community.Stuck behind a rock and a hard place.</sentencetext>
