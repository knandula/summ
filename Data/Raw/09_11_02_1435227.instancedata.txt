	<title>Bacteria Could Survive In Martian Soil</title>

The question of whether life in the form of bacteria (or something even more exotic) exists on Mars is hotly debated, and still lacks a definitive yes or no.

	<htmltext>What isn't said is that water vapour is a far more efficient green house gaz than carbon dioxide. But first thing first, we need to engineer a bacteria that will survive in the harsh environment of Mars and grow into its soil, to release frozen CO2 and water. Once enough of both are present in the atmosphere, we'll be able to introduce plant that survive harsh, desert conditions. Finding the right bacteria is the only tough thing. Once we have it, seeding it is a matter of sending a rocket to the red planet. Once started, the process would have to reach a point where it can sustain itself. Its a matter of starting back the ecosystem that once rose began on Mars. Having the global temperature of the planet being elevated by only 1-2 Celsius degree could melt some more underground water, adding to the green house effect. This wouldn't be instantaneous, but it would mostly be done free of any mankind intervention except at the beginning. After a couple hundred years the condition will be fair enough to introduce plants and bugs, the air would start to become breathable. Its a long term process, but it can be done, fairly easily. The "gardening" task wouldn't have to be accomplish until many hundred years, and we can hope some technology to get to Mars fairly easily will have been invented.</htmltext>

	<htmltext><p>Remember that the Earth has had several large impacts in the past, and that many of these events hurled tons of rocks and debris into space.  Some of them at the proper angle and with enough force to leave orbit.</p><p>We have found extremophiles hibernating in air pockets within rocks that had been air tight for hundreds of years.  Is it so much of a stretch to assume that some of these debris might have carried life from earth to another planet?  Realize that Mars doesn't have anywhere near the same level of atmosphere as the earth.  It isn't as protected against small meteorite impacts.  I could easily imagine life originating from Earth arriving on another world in the form of microorganisms.  It might not be Mars, but maybe Europa instead.  Maybe Earth life is already spreading itself throughout the Orion Arm.</p><p>Disclaimer:<br>Distances in space reduce the chances of this scenario considerably.

<tokenext>Remember that the Earth has had several large impacts in the past , and that many of these events hurled tons of rocks and debris into space .
Some of them at the proper angle and with enough force to leave orbit.We have found extremophiles hibernating in air pockets within rocks that had been air tight for hundreds of years .
Is it so much of a stretch to assume that some of these debris might have carried life from earth to another planet ?
Realize that Mars does n't have anywhere near the same level of atmosphere as the earth .
It is n't as protected against small meteorite impacts .

	<htmltext>It seems that if the conditions permit certain strains of bacteria to live for a while, that almost guarantees that a million years later the planet would be covered with bacteria perfectly adapted for the environment.  The harsher conditions and greater difficulty pulling energy out of the environment might result in equilibrium being reached at a much less active biosphere than on Earth, but it seems almost inevitable.  I guess the critical question is how realistic is it that bacteria have survived the trip from Earth to Mars on the backs of meteorites?</htmltext>

It is important to separate real empirical science from the pseudo-science that is really an alternative system of belief. If we just look at empirical facts, the probability of finding life twice in the same solar system is not huge.

In fact I think we should send bacteria-filled pods to as many planets/asteroids we can afford to.. this should be cheap.. Populate the whole thing.. <br>

Rather than maintaining the question "is there life out there?" we should just force the most pleasant answer: <br>
"Yes.. and we did it!"</htmltext>
