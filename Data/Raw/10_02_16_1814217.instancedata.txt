In the second half of 2009, the number of spam messages sent per day skyrocketed from 600 million to three billion, according to new research.

What if ISPs blocked ports and prevented everyone and his dog from running a mail server by default? (I can already hear the outcry from everyone running his own) - though as with DNS redirections this could be turned off by logging in to your profile (at your ISPs home page)? At least we'd get rid of all the crap coming from bot nets.</htmltext>

ISPs should pay to find the spammers. At some

Often it'll just tag some random message as spam.
I've had various things end up in spam over the years, and really wonder how many landed in there that I never noticed (who checks their spam folder every couple of days?
).Recently I got very upset because I tried to sell something on craigslist, and sure enough, an offer ended up in spam.
Of course I didn't check until a couple of days later, and by then the person wasn't interested any more.
Since I'm going to start job hunting soon, I can't really afford the uncertainty the gmail spam filter introduces, and plan on moving my email elsewhere.
