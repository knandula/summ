	<title>The Psychology of Collection and Hoarding In Games</title>

	<htmltext>This article at Gamasutra takes a look at how <a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news\_index.php?story=23724">the compulsion to hoard and accumulate objects</a>, as well as the desire to accomplish entirely abstract goals, has become part of the modern gaming mindset.
<i>"The Obsessive Compulsive Foundation explains that in compulsive hoarders: 'Acquiring is often associated with positive emotions, such as pleasure and excitement, motivating individuals who experience these emotions while acquiring to keep acquiring, despite negative consequences.' Sound familiar? The 'negative consequences' of chasing after the 120th star in <em>Mario 64</em> or all 100 hidden packages in <em>Grand Theft Auto III</em> may be more subdued than those of filling your entire house with orange peels and old cans of refried beans. But game designers know that it's pretty damn easy to tap into this deep-rooted need to collect and accumulate. And like happy suckers we buy into it all the time, some to a greater degree than others."</i></htmltext>

	<htmltext>How is this flamebait? He brings up a good point, like seriously, the only people who can spend their time doing such a thing after beating a game are:
<br> <br>
Likely inexperienced with games to the point they haven't realized time/reward of doing such a thing is virtually nill<br>
Have a lot of free time on their hands where they really don't have better things to do or other obligations where they really need a game that is to the point<br>
Do not have that much or any money to spend on a new game or other entertainment<br>
Do not have a social partner who would scream murder if they had to watch them try to collect all those things<br>
Have not discovered online competition or do not understand what is good about it<br>
<br>
And that pretty much describes children. Sure adults also fit that criteria but no one can say he is wrong when he says "mostly" children. That certainly doesn't make him flamebait and I think it really shows how pathetic the mod is who got offended by the parent post.</htmltext>

	<htmltext>I glanced through the comments and didn't see it, so I thought I'd mention what I know.

I just finished my junior year in college, and at my institution we took a pretty rigorous (read: I can't believe I survived) course in psychology. Though it was an intro course, we got a new prof and she felt the need to cover numerous parts of the brain and detail their functions / interactions with other parts (she was a cognitive scientist, so her affinity to detail in brain studies makes sense).

To make a long story short, we learned that the part of the brain responsible for hoarding is called the "right mesial prefrontal cortex." This part of the brain is present in everyone; genetic factors and other reasons provide for its excessive activation in some people as opposed to others.

This explains why some people hoard much more than others (even though almost everyone possesses the same basic circuitry). Furthermore, certain companies (we focused on advertising companies, but the gaming industry works in this case as well) intentionally focus on tapping this circuitry to make a buck.

From this, we get the McDonald's Beanie Baby rush, the Furby craze, and a host of other collectible furors we all remember. It seems that with some collectibles (Pokemon, anyone?) we just can't help ourselves.</htmltext>

Multiple sets of all the armors, weapons, and huge amounts of reagents all laid out on the floor in neat grids.My pride and joy was stealing the full set of dramora armor off of the guy who helps you with corpus disease.
I made a low DPS dagger with huge magical armor damage and broke the armor off his body.
Then I knocked him out bare handed and robbed him and charmed him back to friendly.
Each item was enchanted with a variable stat increase.
All decked out I was totally unstoppable.The best hoard was all the moon sugar in the game, which I ate all at once.
When I ran and jumped it would load four or five games tiles before I hit the ground.
It never wore off before I was bored of the game.I am replaying Ultima Underworld right now on DOSBOX and am fighting my self not to hoard because items have no effect in that game really and trade is useless.
P.S. Where is the bandit's hideout behind the store room?
I cannot find it at all.</sentencetext>

	<htmltext>When I first read the article title I misread it to be Hoarding of Games and it started me thinking of way back in my computer days in the early 80's.

The same psychology of hoarding gave me pause, and reminded me of the kids I used to know that would try to collect every game for a system that they could. Pirated of course. Some people used to try and collect every piece of software written for old Apple II or Atari's. They spent so much time collecting and trying to collect that most of what they had they never even played or used once. It made me reconsider what I thought about piracy....stealing, sharing, collecting. I'm still not sure what I think of this inbred way of going about things in the human species, but I find the urge to hoard interesting.

When someone has 10,000 pieces of software or 20,000, what does it mean? After the 200,000th song or the 10,000 movie.... what then..... more collecting, different collecting.</htmltext>

Achievements are motivational because off of a sense of accomplishment, giving a person a positive sense of self-worth (or introjected worth, external acceptance in other words). Obsessive behaviours are not the same at all. I can't speak for hoarders but as far as "checkers" go, it tends to be motivated by fear, from a chemical imbalance according to the medical theory, although more modern thinking now says it's due to introjects in early life. <br>

A friend of mine was watching me play and said "Why do you pick up every single alchemical ingredient like some kind of demented vacuum cleaner?
"

The houses in Morrowind were never large enough, I ended up using the toolset to build myself a lair for my ill-gotten loot.
My killer combo in that game was Boots of Blinding Speed + Hide of the Apostle + Daedric Crescent.
It was like Worf meets the Flash.
I'd still be playing Oblivion if it didn't crash on my system every ten to thirty minutes.</sentencetext>

	<htmltext>I have to admit to buying multiple copies of games due to memory failure of the brain. I just give the old copy to friends. I own over 100 Xbox360 games, 70 \% of those I don't play anymore. 20\% that I never played after buying them, and 10\% that I tend to rotate by the week or month.

My PC collection is very similar as th 360 as far as the percentages go, but the number of games is considerably higher (around 250ish, possibly much higher). I buy new games on Steam, Impulse, Direct2Drive and at Gamestop, along with other stores that may have a good deal going on.

I'm also obsessive compulsive.

If they can make it seem like video games are designed around some sinister theory of exploiting human psychology to mind-control the players, then they can feel justified in demonizing gaming as a whole.</sentencetext>

<sentencetext>I found in Balder's Gate, (one of the last games I seriously tried to play), that I enjoyed trying to build a strong and efficient character with effective tools/weapons, but that after a while I saw the pattern of more difficult challenges increasing the demand for more powerful weapons/tools.
When the pattern became obvious to my base, automatic nature; (intellectually I knew from the outset how such games were designed), I lost all interest in the game because it felt repetitive and the story was uninteresting.
I quit about a quarter of the way through.My base, automatic nature, I think, has figured out that the more effective survival technique is to learn the over-arching pattern behind a challenge and then find a way to hack the system rather than to defeat the challenge head-on directly.
--Once a pattern is understood, the need to engage in more base magpie-like behavior becomes pointless, and thus my "reward center" stops pumping happy juice into the rest of my brain.Games which DO manage to engage me forever and ever are more akin to territory-winning combat scenarios where the 'enemy' is constantly advancing.
My survival instincts, even if they recognize the old patterns, will nonetheless be stirred to action when they can predict the loss of territory and life if I take no action whatsoever.
