With this simile , we can describe the features of an object by comparing it to another , unrelated object.Example : Joe is so strong , he is like an ox.In this example , Joe clearly has no actual relation to an ox ( we hope ) , however comparing him to an ox relates a charactaristic of Joe 's , his strength , with a charactaristic easily noted when one looks at an ox - oxen are very strong compared to humans .
