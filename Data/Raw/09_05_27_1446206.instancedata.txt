That's actually a common misconception. In GPS positioning you have four variables to be determined, your position on the earth (X,Y,Z coordinates) as well as the error of the receiver clock.

The reason many handheld or car navigation systems also work with three satellites is that they keep one variable, usually the height, fixed in their calculations. You can either use the last known value if a satellite disappears over the horizon or you can just get it from, for example, the navigational maps in your system. When you're driving along some road it generally doesn't matter whether you're 100 meters above or below the road, but it may matter if you're 100 meters to the left or right. This usually doesn't impact the usefulness of the device very much but may allow you to get a fix on your location when you otherwise wouldn't.</p></div>

	<htmltext>That the pulsars move relative to each other (and us) is true - but this is an extremely minor point.  The pulsars all have very large masses, which means it would take something HUGE to alter their trajectory significantly.  Until that happens, that large mass translates to very predictable movement.<br> <br>
The periodicity of the pulsar is more problematic.  With a sudden introduction of mass, or a sudden readjustment in the matter of the pulsar, the frequency can abruptly change.  And yet, this isn't even so much of an issue.  The pulsars will be monitored from some location (Earth or otherwise), and changes to their behaviour can be uploaded to the Galactic Positioning System receivers shortly after the change is observed.  The receivers might compute positions incorrectly in the interim, but more likely "dead reckoning", combined with other pulsar observations could be used to determine the erroneous input, and ignore it until the update.<br> <br>
A more serious "flaw" is that the pulsar emissions are not (at first blush) "marked" with an emission time.  One pulse looks more or less like the next.  If a pulse occurs once-a-second, this translates to 300,000 km between pulse fronts.  If your positioning space exceeds this length, you might end up with ambiguity in your resulting position calculation.  The other 3 pulsars will provide constraints, making certain "single pulse off-by-one" errors easily discarded.  But as your location space grows, it becomes more than possible for multiple location solutions to a given set of pulse-front timings.  With Earth's GPS system, each satellite's transmission is coded with both a satellite identifier and timing information, making this type of error impossible.</htmltext>

	<htmltext>It makes the problem more complicated, but it does not add error.  You don't think the GPS satellites are stationary, do you?  The source of error here is uncertainty in the measurements of those positions.  And it actually isn't that bad -- start your spacecraft near Sol, with position well enough defined that you know which pulse you're receiving.  (When observing, you can only see the relative phasing of the pulsars, unlike GPS satellites which transmit a time base.)  Then you need to count pulses as you move.  You then know that, relative to your starting point (or, equivalently, the epoch), you've seen X0 pulses from pulsar 0, X1 from pulsar 1, etc.  Knowing how many pulses closer to each of the pulsars you are tells you how far you are from your starting point (in spacetime, not just space, obviously).  The error bars get larger as you move enough to get parallax effects -- since from Earth we can only measure the distance to a pulsar with modest precision, and its velocity perpendicular to us with even less.  If, however, you have a radio telescope that can resolve the position of the pulsar with good precision, you get to add a long baseline parallax measurement to correct for that.  Add a timebase transmitter at Earth as well, and the errors basically disappear -- errors of a few nanoseconds should be readily available.  And once you're far enough away from Sol to make that transmitter difficult (more than a few lightyears), you'll know the pulsar trajectories well enough it won't matter as much.</htmltext>

	<htmltext><p>I've been looking into this since 2001.  The biggest real problem is detecting the pulsars.  The free space signal loss is on the order of -400db.  The math is much harder than dealing with GPS and you have to find the easy way to figure out tick counts.   Other than that, its workable. Modern GPS receivers do have methods to remove pulsar noise from the signals they are watching.  Defining a coordinate system will be a mess as well but that could lead to a reasonable way to define things for all planets as well.  Nearly everything in space rotates and most rotate the same direction in about the same plane so you can define a north and south.  The real problem is how do you define the origin of Longitude?  I suspect the best way is define it by the highest point on the planet but that leads to problems when the highest point is at the unstable edge of an active volcano.

	<htmltext>This is not a new idea.  Actually, this idea has been thought about before and dismissed.  The researchers referenced propose using millisecond radio pulsars for navigation.  This is a poor idea from an engineering standpoint because it requires having a large collecting area of radio dishes in order to get an apporpriate signal level.<br>
<br>
A better idea, which is currently being researched, and was suggested four years ago (at least the earliest I recall it being mentioned) was using x-ray pulsars, which require much smaller collecting area.  See for example <a href="http://www.lib.umd.edu/drum/handle/1903/2856" title="umd.edu" rel="nofollow"> this thesis </a> [umd.edu] on the subject.</htmltext>

Just as we rely on atomic clocks for split-second accuracy, they in turn are set using pulsars.

According to LaViolette, pulsars are not naturally occurring objects, but rather, they represent an intelligent design. One intended for timekeeping, navigation and which serves as a faster-than-light warning system for events called galactic superwaves. At best, these superwaves are an annoyance to industrialized societies. At worst, they can and do trigger extinction level events (ELE).

	<htmltext>Someone enlighten me.

I know with local GPS, the time is encoded on the signal.  Its not just a difference in "tick"'s from different satellites.  At some point a time is encoded to tell us which "tick" that last "tick" was.

I'm going out on a limb and saying no one's flown out to these Pulsars and encoded "which millisecond tick is which" in the datastream.

So if my ship flies inside a large hole in an asteroid (while avoiding Xur and the Kodan Armada), when I come back out, how will I know how many milliseconds I've missed from each pulsar?

Surely across Galactic scale, and relativistic effects. . . just accurately counting the time between ticks from Pulsar to Pulsar won't be enough to know where you are.  You'll have to know which tick is which.  (Or is everyone assuming its like gyroscopes. . . you spin them up, and have to keep them going. . . or you're lost forever . .<nobr> <wbr></nobr>.)
