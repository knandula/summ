	<title>Charities Upset Over Chase Facebook Contest</title>

	<htmltext>ssv03 writes <i>"The New York Times is reporting that Chase Community Giving of Chase Bank recently held a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/19/us/19charity.html?\_r=1">contest on Facebook</a> in which users were encouraged to vote for their favorite charities. At the end of the contest, the 100 charities with the most votes would win $25,000 and advance to the next round to have a chance to win $1 million. Initially, the vote counts for each organization were made public, but two days before voting ended they were hidden, and the final totals have still not been released. While Chase had no official leader board during the voting, several organizations were keeping track of projected winners. Those projections were almost identical to the final results, yet several organizations including Students for Sensible Drug Policy (SSDP), Marijuana Policy Project and several anti-abortion groups were not finalists. They had been performing very well (some within the top 20) until the vote counters were removed. Chase Bank has so far refused to discuss the issue with the organizations.  SSDP has <a href="http://ssdp.org/documents/Chase-Boycott-Release.pdf">spoken out in a press release</a> (PDF) and is calling for a boycott."</i></htmltext>

<tokenext>The people who are voting for the drug organizations are idiots who need to put down the bong for long enough to see that there are other human being starving and dying and suffering .
The thought that people are putting the legalization of a recreational drug over say giving somebody a hot meal sickens me.While throwing someone in prison for smoking or growing something completely natural , destroys their credibility , severely affects their ability to get most jobs and ruins their life is n't such a problem with you ?
I 'm not saying people who are starving are unimportant , far from it , but to say that it 's simply a matter of a recreational drug is pure ignorance on your part , and it is you who sickens me .</tokentext>

	<htmltext>The reason a corporation give money to a charity isn't because it believes in the charity, but because it will get a blurb in paper saying how good they are and increase the brand good will.  Does anyone really expect a corporation to spend $25000 so it can be on the news with a headline "Chase supports legalizing Drugs".  I won't even get to the quagmire around abortion.  I'm sure if they do this again, they'll pre-screen organizations that are allowed to participate.  Frankly I'd been more concerned if they screened out an organization that helps people get out of credit card debt.</htmltext>
