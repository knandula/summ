	<title>The State of Video Game Physics</title>
	<author>Soulskill</author>
	<datestamp>1246126200000</datestamp>
	<htmltext>The Guardian's games blog convened a panel of engineers and other experts to talk about the current state of video game physics. A great deal of research is currently going on <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/gamesblog/2009/jun/22/games-physics">to make better use of multiple cores</a> so that advanced physics tools and engines can take advantage of all the processing power available in modern computers. Many of those tools are being put to work these days to <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/gamesblog/2009/jun/23/games-physics">find more realistic ways of breaking things</a>, and game developers are trying to wrap their heads around destructible environments. Mike Enoch, lead coder at Ruffian Games, said, "This idea of simulating interactions and constructing the game world similar to how you would construct the real world generates more emergent gameplay, where the game plays out in a unique way for each player, and the player can come up with solutions to problems that the designer might not have thought of." Another area that still sees a lot of attention is <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/gamesblog/2009/jun/23/games-physics1">making game characters more human</a>, in terms of moving and looking as realistic as possible, as well as <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/gamesblog/2009/jun/25/games-gameculture">how a game's AI perceives what's happening</a>. "The problem is not necessarily in having the most advanced path-finding technique with large-scale awareness; we need to have more micro behaviors, with a proper physics awareness of the environment," said software engineer George Torres.</htmltext>

A lot of the research on destructible geometry they're talking about is a process of doing the destruction automatically, without the need for an artist to define how every possible piece of debris looks.

<sentencetext>Way back when I was playing Syndicate for the first time and marveling at how awesome it was, I was still struck by how much cooler it would be if I could level buildings.
Even these days, games like GTA would be even cooler if buildings could be as thoroughly trashed as the cars are.

	<htmltext>A common work around for that problem is to initiate a plot sequence at the beginning of a scene change. This method is more common for large world and 3rd person. Another approach is a penalty system where the player is punished for destroying a plot sequence. This method is used frequently in first person shooters where a mission is failed due to friendly fire. In both cases, the key to addressing this issue is scope management. As games get more complex I imagine tools will automate the relation between objects and their references within some scope. If the object is referenced beyond its initial scope (when and where it was created), such a tool would automatically expand the scope and implement some sort of generic default action (mission failed?). It's a very interesting problem because it hints at the need for a virtual timeline as a means of identifying or creating the scope of a given plot sequence.</htmltext>

Space-based games (i. e., ones involving the behavior of light, planets, and other celestial entities) written to conform to actual physics laws would be a fun way to teach students how to intuit physics.

This generation of students is just damned lucky to have access to such computing power.  In the old days, the most readily accessible computing power was an 8080 hobbyist board.  Simulating the universe on that is impossible.  The students of that era were stuck with just manipulating integrals and derivatives.

	<htmltext>When a developer creates distructable scenery and lots of alternate routes, it means that they have to produce a lot more content, that the user won't see on every run-through. This means games get shorter (or development times get longer). Admittedly, one sees higher replay value, but generally that's not considered as valuable.
Personally, I miss the epicly long singleplayer games of old (Half Life 1 anyone?), and would like to have the best of both worlds. Unfortunately, the tendancy is towards very short single player games.</htmltext>

	<htmltext><p>...it's the gameplay, stupid!</p><p>Technology is nice and all, but if it ain't fun to play then who gives a damn?  Granted, if a game utilizes new technologies in order to create a unique gameplay experience, then all is well.  The problem is, most of them don't.  It seems like the article is mainly looking at FPS games where you can blow up the environment.  SNORE.</p><p>Unless the technology complements the gameplay experience, then all you have in your hands is boring tech demo with some re-hashed gameplay on the side.  I couldn't care less if the debris from whatever I just blew up bounces and reacts in a true-to-life fashion.

<tokenext>...it 's the gameplay , stupid ! Technology is nice and all , but if it ai n't fun to play then who gives a damn ?
Granted , if a game utilizes new technologies in order to create a unique gameplay experience , then all is well .
The problem is , most of them do n't .
It seems like the article is mainly looking at FPS games where you can blow up the environment .
SNORE.Unless the technology complements the gameplay experience , then all you have in your hands is boring tech demo with some re-hashed gameplay on the side .
I could n't care less if the debris from whatever I just blew up bounces and reacts in a true-to-life fashion .

A dozen years ago I developed and demoed the <a href="http://www.animats.com/" title="animats.com">first ragdoll physics system that worked.</a> [animats.com]  Among other things, I'm responsible for the "ragdoll falling downstairs" cliche; that started with a demo I did in 1997. I looked at ragdolls as a first step. I was expecting game development to go in the direction of physically-based characters driven by active control of character muscles.  That hasn't happened.
</p><p>
The problem is partly technical and partly dramatic.  The dramatic part I encountered in dealing with Hollywood types.  What directors want is to specify the start and end conditions; the job of the system is to realistically get the character to the desired ending mark.  In real-world stunt work, there are wires, guides, and rails that make things go the way the director wants, even when that's not physically realistic.  When that's not enough, cuts are used to conceal the lack of realism.
</p><p>
Physics systems are inherently unidirectional - you keep working forward from the current state. This is fundamentally incompatible with directorial control.  As a result, the
trend in character animation has been to get enough motion capture data to cover the things you want the character to do, and use a motion splicing engine to patch the pieces together. (This, incidentally, was first used in Godzilla, the movie, for the baby 'zillas).  That's become more or less the standard approach for games.
</p><p>
Using a character control AI to drive the character's muscles realistically has been attempted, but with modest success.  Motion Factory tried this in the 1990s; their system was only kinematic, and not too successful.  Havok is trying it now.  For this to work, you need computerized muscle control good enough to drive a real-world robot, like Big Dog.  And then it has to look good from an aesthetic perspective.   It's really a hard robotics problem, which is why I was interested in it in the first place.
</p><p>
From a gameplay perspective, if you take the physics seriously, you lose the "superhero" capabilities of game characters.  Jump off a balcony, and don't expect to land on your feet.
Jumping up to a balcony?  Forget it.  Hand-to-hand combat works about as well as it does at the dojo.  ("Your left foot was too far forward for that throw. Again!" "Yes, sensi.") Trying to control a physically realistic character via a joystick is nearly hopeless. You can't even drive a real car very well through a remote joystick, let alone a game pad.  (I've actually done that; using a remote steering wheel is a huge improvement over a joystick.) In driving games for consoles, the physics is tweaked to make the car incredibly stable.  (Lowering the center of gravity to below ground is a common trick.)
</p><p>
So what do we have? Ragdolls. "Infinitely destructible environments."  Some skin deformation. Cloth.  Plus rain, snow, water, and explosions that don't feed into the game play at all. (That's mostly what the "physics cards" do.)</p></htmltext>

	<htmltext>There is plenty software makers can do to make games more playable and enjoyable - start looking at the scripts, story play and character acting. The console gaming segment has made for fairly linear stories to get to check-points. Look, I'm not saying that the 80s games were terrific either with the "get object A and take to room B" gameplay, but there was only so much to stuff into 64Kb of memory. Some RPG open stories and environments, like Oblivion and Sacred show how characeters that want to explore and advance their character the way they want can do it. Far Cry 2 is a rare modern shooter that has the same concept.

I'm sure it is cheaper to explore this avenue and probably more succesful than to invest in working out how to get quad cores cranking. I'm still using DX9 and happy with it.

	<htmltext>Portal is probably the best example of physics designed around the game, not the other way around. Or maybe not. In either case, Portal was a blast even though it was probably one of the simplest, shortest games I've ever played.

You know what I'd love to see? A scifi game that actually played around with gravity. Every scifi game (where you can get out of a ship and run around) has the same gravity in every location. Take Mass Effect for example: You fly up to a planet and check it out: Most of them have near Earth gravity. Then there's a mission on Earths moon, and guess what? The Moon has the same gravity as Earth! Why? Oh, right, because the game engine only supports a single, unified gravity for any given environment.
This is why scifi games usually suck. When you can't even represent what it would be like to be in lower gravity, what's the friggin point of visiting other planets? How about space stations that use rotational gravity?

But think! These days maps are critically designed to have you go from A to B to C on the prescribed path through the prescribed targets. If you could jump up on a ridge and run past that, well, there goes a bunch of development hours down the tube. But how grand it would be! I miss the freedom of movement in games. The day I logged into a new game and I couldn't jump over a curb, I think I died a little.</htmltext>
