and that very same though was what goes through my mind why the space race went so frantically up until the point the american flag was planted in the moon, and since then, no other country bothered to go.
I know that there are covenants that say such territory ownerships do not cover the moon, but they said the same thing about the Arctic Circle and that didn't stop Russia from making a territorial claim.
Who knows, maybe they find oil or diamonds under the lunar surface and the US might just one day say "just kidding, we are claiming the moon as the 51st state".

Garriott may or may not own a legal title to Lunokhod it is by no means a given that the auction sale was a legitimate title, but there is no way buying Lunokhod gives him any ownership rights to any piece of the Moon, however small.From http://www.space.com/news/soviet-moon-rover-space-law-100322.html space.com: Validity of ownership?
Enter space lawyer, Joanne Irene Gabrynowicz.
She is Director of the National Center for Remote Sensing, Air and Space Law and Research Professor of Law at the University of Mississippi.
"The soundness of a property right depends in large part on the integrity of the documents that memorialize the right," Gabrynowicz told SPACE.com via email.
"This is why property buyers conduct title searches before buying property.
They want to be sure that the title is good.
Gabrynowicz said that without reading the papers or knowing how they were processed and by whom, she can't speak to the validity of the ownership of a space object purchased at auction.
"However, a contention that buying a space object that landed on the lunar surface from a sovereign nation gives rise to a property right to the territory under it is wrong," Gabrynowicz said.
Gabrynowicz said that States-Parties to the Outer Space Treaty of 1966 cannot acquire lunar territory by landing an object on the moon.
"The USSR was and Russia is a party to the Outer Space Treaty," she added.
"It did not acquire the territory under the object when it landed.
One cannot sell what one does not own.
Since USSR/Russia did not have a property right to the territory under the landed object, there was nothing to sell.

Wow.
No fact checking.
Typical over-the-top-can't-get-the-facts-right journalism.
The article tries to paint Lord British as laying claim to the entire moon, in the title, when in reality he's only even trying to claim at least the land on which the rover sits, and at most the land the rover crossed before it laid to rest.The lawyer who was quoted when asked if he really owned the lander, is, quite frankly, covering her ass, as any good lawyer would do, when asked a question like that.
What she says, that she can't determine if he owns it or not without seeing the title, is true.
Any good lawyer would say the same thing if you called them to ask if you owned your house.
They're not going to assume you do, even if you have been living there for the last 10 years.
That would be borderline malpractice.What Gariott is doing is, in fact, not nearly as crazy as it sounds.
Since virtually every spacefaring nation gave up their rights to the moon in the Outer Space Treaty, any claims to the moon by right of discovery that could have been made by the US or Russia as USSR's successor state are void under international law.
The treaty, however, does not contemplate private ownership of the moon.
Gariott actually has a number of very very reasonable legal arguments that he owns a part of the moon.
Yes, it does sound very strange to a lay person that he might have a "right of discovery" some land on the moon, since in the lay sense he did obviously not discover the moon.
That said, legally, it's not unreasonable to say that he might.
Nor is it unreasonable to say that he might gain the land through simply owning the rover on it long enough.While the auction could not and did not sell him the land, this does not mean he can't own it.
If no-one owns the land, then there are a number of legal ways to acquire it, as I've briefly discussed above.The article, frankly, was clearly written by someone with no understanding of the legal circumstances around the matter.
_EOE_Anonymous9
Last time I heard, there was an international treaty or something preventing countries from owning the moon, or the rest of the solar system for that matter.Lord British aka Richard Garriot is a citizen of one of those signatory countries, and I believe that also prevents him from laying claim.On top of that, the little understanding I have of settler or homesteading laws require that the person be on that land, and he has never been to the moon.Trying to claim that you own the land under or near your 2nd hand space junk is kind of like claiming you own the land around a rock you threw into the fog.Now as nobody has made any attempts at recovery of the lander I suspect international law allows a salvager to claim it, if they salvage it.
Not likely to happen anytime soon.
Of course, IANAL, and this is all just my opinion based on the few things I've read on some of these laws, but still, let's get some sense in here.Besides, everyone knows that the best lunar property is on the darkside.

No doubt he's bought the vehicle, but it seems like the ownership of the parking spot may still be contested.
Still, I guess he's got a better excuse than most to mount a private space program so he can go and pick it up.
In this instance, the moon artefact was bought direct from its owner, but it's also fun to think about the problems the delivery page would have caused eBay's programmers if it had passed through the used space vehicle market that way.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outer\_Space\_Treaty wikipedia.orgAs a citizen of a nation whom signed that treaty, his government's law is still held over him, and the UK law by treaty is that no nation or person can own the moon, it is there for all of mankind.Maybe possibly he could do so if he has his citizenship canceled Is that possible in the UK?
I know it is in the USA but obviously that doesn't apply hereHowever with no citizenship to pretty much any first world nation with space technology, that will leave him out in the cold for trying to claim his property.
He also stands a good chance of getting shot down if he did somehow manage to launch from a country that does not have a space program.

Didn't some company in Neveda try selling titles/deeds to the Moon years back?
You know, I don't think any of those titles/deeds are going to be worth anything.
I think true ownership will be when someone actually takes up residence or makes use of a given property on the Moon.
No pointing and saying, "Hey, that there, it's mine!
"I'm not a lawyer, but common sense sort of dictates this, doesn't it?
I mean, under whose authority will those titles/deeds be enforced?

According to an article in Popular Mechanics popularmechanics.com from the June 2008 issue:With the space race in full flower, though, the real worry was national sovereignty.
Both the United States and the Soviet Union wanted to reach the moon first but, in fact, each was more worried about what would happen if they arrived second.
Fears that the competition might trigger World War III led to the 1967 Outer Space Treaty, which was eventually ratified by 62 countries.
According to article II of the treaty, "Outer Space, including the moon and other celestial bodies, is not subject to national appropriation by claim of sovereignty, by means of use or occupation, or by any other means.
"Ideally, title would be recognized by an international agreement that all nations would endorse.
The 1979 Moon Treaty was a flop, but there's no reason the space powers couldn't agree on a new treaty that recognizes property rights and encourages investment.
After all, the international climate has warmed to property rights and capitalism over the past 30 years.

It is possible that someday a group of private super rich citizens or a corporation will make some spaceships and fly to the moon, build a lunar base there, and live there.
It is possible for them to do it long before a government does it.
That would be really interesting because they could reasonably claim the moon as theirs.
The response of various countries to this claim would be even more interesting.
I'll bet there would be a lot more interest in going to the moon right away to move out those squatters.

".. retarded foetus" ?
?You might begin your re-education by using this link: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foetus wikipedia.org.
Your use of the word 'retarded' suggests that you are aware of at least one 'IQ' test appropriate to a fetus old, misguided spellings are not used in science.
If you know of such a test, kindly inform us so that we can possibly ask you to take it.
Your score will then be compared inappropriately, yes, but as a 'chastising', no.So, you see, you have opened the door to the exploration of at least two errors: 1 archaic spelling is not scientific, and 2 the presumption that you can define 'retarded fetus' in any meaningful way.
I suggest you return to your pseudo-erudite and disingenuous cave and beg forgiveness of the party whom you so rudely bullied.

Article 11, paragraph 2 of the Moon Treaty states:
"The moon is not subject to national appropriation by any claim of
