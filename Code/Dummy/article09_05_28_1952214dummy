An anonymous reader writes "A Turkish hacking ring has broken into 2 sensitive US Army servers, according to a new investigation uncovered by InformationWeek.
The hackers, who go by the name 'm0sted' and are based in Turkey, penetrated servers at the Army's McAlester Ammunition Plant in Oklahoma in January.
Users attempting to access the site were redirected to a page featuring a climate-change protest.
In Sept, 2007, the hackers breached Army Corps of Engineers servers.
That hack sent users to a page containing anti-American and anti-Israeli rhetoric.
The hackers used simple SQL Server injection techniques to gain access.
That's troubling because it shows a major Army security lapse, and also the ability to bypass supposedly sophisticated Defense Department tools and procedures designed to prevent such breaches.

Pardon the rant, but can anyone tell me why we're still having people write code that is subject to SQL injection attacks?I mean, sometimes potential buffer overflows in C/C++ programs can be tricky to notice.
Writing threading code that's not subject to deadlock or starvation can often be a challenge.But isn't code that's subject to SQL injection attacks just blindingly, amazingly obvious at first glance?
_EOE_Anonymous6
So much for Information Week being reasoned and sensible.
"Equally troubling is the fact that the hacks appear to have originated outside the United States.
Turkey is known to harbor significant elements of the al-Qaida network.
It was not clear if "m0sted" has links to the terrorist group.
" Hooray for sensationalism!

I'm just playing devil's advocate but who puts their public website inside their defences?I know it is an extremely common practice in this country to actually put sites like these on standard third party hosting services e.g.
Rackspace.They set them up to be as secure as other e-commerce sites, so fairly secure, but without having to poke holes in a nice heavy firewall.

I didn't bother to RTFA, but summary is inflamatory at best.A public-facing, high-profile perception server gets compromised?
That's not news.Let's say it is news for a minute.

This is not a "major Army security lapse" by any stretch of the imagination.Of course, my line of thinking wouldn't be widely accepted because it ignores the emotional response that the summary probably provokes in most people.

the ability to adapt new tactics as previously good tactics become irrelevantone way a tactic becomes irrelevant is changing battlefield conditions.
you don't fight in a swamp the way you fight in a desert, for instancewell, the internet is valid battlefield.
and you fight on it with new tactics.
it remains to be seen now if the us military understands that1.
it needs to take this battlefield seriously2.
it can develop good tactics to fight on this battlefieldbut as it stands now, a bunch of teenagers are thoroughly and repeatedly trouncing the us military

The US military is pretty much incapable of fighting a guerrilla war where the combatents are intermixed with civilians and civilian casualties are forbidden.
It made Vietnam very difficult and it has made Iraq difficult as well.What we have is a guerrilla war against hackers where they are effectiely shielded in most cases by the ISP and their own country's law enforcement.
The end result is almost an unwinnable war.We are winning in Iraq by ending the use of civilians as shields.
We won in Vietnam by separating the combatants from the civilians.
It is going to take that sort of effort to win against hackers, crackers and identity thieves.
Unfortunately, right now the effort required to do this is intense enough that it is many, many times the losses so far.
So I don't think they are going to do anything until the losses mount up a lot more.What makes this worse is in order to effectively combat these people it is going to take either the cooperation of foreign law enforcement or just going around them.
Neither one is going to make these other countries want to be our friends, but they seem to be happy with the hackers running around doing whatever.

These were not "Army" sites and they are not maintained or administered by soldiers.
One is for a munitions plant where the government owns the facility but it is leased to a private company who operates it for the government.

As mentioned by other posters, since we don't know how old the system is, we can't really measure it against "modern" perceptions.In addition, they could be a victim of this kind of thing: Contractor:  We'd like to make a prototype for a web site that will do XYZ.
Govt: K, here's some cash.
Contractor:  Here's a prototype, now can we have some cash to convert it from a prototype into a real system?
Govt: Nah.
I'd have to fill out a lot of paperwork for that.
We'll just use the prototype.
_EOE_jeff4747
?Who says it's behind their real defenses?Look, it's a web server on the Internet.
It's gonna need at least a firewall.
Just like if they used Rackspace to host it and you were behind Rackspace's firewall.
But there's also gonna be additional defenses for other systems.And, btw, anything that's on the server is gonna be unclassified or somebody's goin' to jail regardless of the breach.

What you have is a few teenagers writing graffiti on the army bulletin board located outside the base.
And yes, the War on Vandals is likely unwinnable.
However, you might try declaring War on Exaggeration.We won in Vietnam by separating the combatants from the civilians.
You didn't win in Vietnam, you lost and fled.
_EOE_jeff4747
Not really.
Do you have any idea just how many computers have .mil addresses?
If somebody screwed up on the configuration for an infinitesimally small percentage of them, that's still a lot of systems open to attack.
And the script kiddies will get lucky.But the US military also doesn't talk about their own "cyber" offensive and defensive capabilities for obvious reasons.
Which leads to the erroneous presumption that such capabilities don't exist.Besides, these kinds of stories are great for getting additional funding for somebody's pet project.
Much like Kennedy's complaining about the "Missile Gap" when he beat Nixon.
No such gap existed, but it let Kennedy spend a lot of money fixing the gap.

A lot of ODBC/JDBC/Insert DB connector tutorials I saw even a few years ago do dodgy stuff like string concatenation with the user input instead of proper parametrization.

All his examples joined strings.

Changing wording to create fiction in the hope that somebody gullible will hand over some cash is not the way to fight this increasingly organised and increasingly common criminal activity, but unfortunately that is how the current head of the NSA and others scrambling for funding are doing it.
One such idiot full of cyberhype recently showed he knew less about Trojans than anyone with even a passing knowlege of european culture let alone a computer professional ie.
the Trojan horse lets the other nasty stuff in.
Forget the "guerrilla war against hackers" bullshit since the people we really want to catch are fraudsters, money launderers and the occassional trespasser onto military networks which makes them a spy and not some "cyberterrorist".
When we escalate the words into the realm of fantasy you end up with pointless running around in circles trying to catch fantastic supervillians that may not exist instead of looking at reality and catching those that do exist.

Seems we don't have to know much about the situation to know one thing... a "major Army security lapse" is more like, say, strategic radio comm in the clear, close enough to be intercepted by the enemy, and results in casualties.A public facing website that gets script-kiddied by some asshat from Turkey that thinks exploiting a site by SQL injection is Uber-L33t is not a major lapse.

That's doubtful at the best of times, but for the sake of argument entertain you.by ending the use of civilians as shields.
No you haven't.
There hasn't been any noticeable decrease in violence, just less reporting of it.
Just because the US army has the media on a tight leash doesn't mean that you're winning, in fact this is about the only lesson the US armed forces learned in Vietnam and in my opinion the most useless one taught.We won in Vietnam
Ahh yes, we've all seen the famous "victory in Vietnam" photo.
You know the one where all the people are rushing to the roof of the US embassy to get on the last chopper out of Saigon.by separating the combatants from the civilians.
Once again, you did no such thing.

Yes we ended the use of civilians as shields.
We ended this by changing the term "Civilians" to "Enemy Combatants".
No matter what "term" you use to call them the people we are killing is the local population.
You can call them Enemy Combatants but it doesn't change the fact they are women and children.We won in Vietnam by separating the combatants from the civilians.Dude  we lost that stupid war!
I know I was there!
The reason we lost was we could not separate the combatants from the civilians because the Combatants WERE!
the civilians!
No one except the poloticat eliete wanted us their.
They are a happy thriving peaceful country now that we are gone.The one thing the US Military has yet to figure out is you can win a war against an "Army" but you cannot win a war against a "People" except by completely wiping them out.

This was nothing more than a simple-minded attack on a handful of public websites containing NO classified data.The U.S. military follows a rigid security discipline of having separate network for secure "black" and non-secure "red" traffic.

But this so called cyberwarfare that previous posters are talking about that requires outlandish budgets because it's supposedly more dangerous than real warfare is only dangerous when you link weapons to computers.
And here we are sitting on top of tens of thousands of nuclear bombs controlled by computers, and building airplanes and tanks and robots with guns.
It doesn't matter if they're linked to the internet or not.
The fact remains they have radio receivers that can give commands to shoot and kill people.

I completely agree.
All of my SQL variables are escaped IMMEDIATELY before the executed code.
This way, you can look at any SQL code I've written and instantly know if it's secure or not.
I would call this code "obviously secure" at least the SQL part is.
It may still contain bugs, but SQL injection won't be possible.
I've seen several other safety mechanisms that escape any variables before sending them to SQL-related functions, but looking inside the function instead of the caller you really don't know what data you have and whether it is safe or not.
I think secure code should be obviously secure.
Of course there are those buffer overflow problems and threading etc like you mention, but how about quit using sprintf and instead use snprintf?
WTF?  And don't give me that "If I know I'm just printing a simple variable and I know how long it is, then it's OK" crap either.
Ever seen a calculator come up with a wrong answer that was really close?
Like 3.99897876 instead of 4?
I have.
And we all know that there have been widely-used CPUs with math processor errors.
If your code isn't obviously secure, I argue that it's not secure.
Especially if you aren't the only developer in the pipeline.
We all organize this code differently in our own heads and what makes sense to one dev is confusing to another.
If the code is obviously secure, most of that is eliminated anyways.
