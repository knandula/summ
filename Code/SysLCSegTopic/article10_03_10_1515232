T1 1 CmdrTaco : astroengine follows up to a story about the LHC shutting down that seems to have hit all the news replicators today.
T1 2 CmdrTaco : "It's to be expected when pushing the frontiers of physics, but the LHC's epic 'will it or won't it' saga continues.
T2 3 CmdrTaco : Due to an unforeseen construction mistake, the LHC will cease experiments for a year (starting around late-2011) so repairs and upgrades can be carried out.
T2 4 CmdrTaco : For now, accelerated particles will have a maximum energy of 7TeV (half the power of the LHC's design maximum), which is ample for at least 18 months of experiments before shutdown.
T2 5 dtmos : ... the article linked in the story starts off by debunking the submission.
T2 6 dtmos : Cox pointed out that accelerator shutdowns are more routine twitter.com than the BBC article the source of this blog post suggests:ALL particle accelerators have 6 - 12 month regular shutdowns for maintenance and upgrades.
T2 7 BobZee1 : This is good news to me because I like job security and the longer Fermi is rocking, the longer I am rocking.
T2 8 Cornwallis : Now I wish /.
T2 9 Cornwallis : would close the thread to prevent inane follow-up like mine.
T2 10 Monkeedude1212 : That Higgs Boson is finding more and more creative ways... Seems this time it went so far back as to flaw the LHC's design.How long do we have before it goes further back and destroys humanity?
T2 11 bucky0 : The plan for a while now was always to have a period of running at lower power/luminosity then a long shutdown to completely fix the error that caused the incident in 2008.
T2 12 bucky0 : Last december the plan was for a 5 month run this year and a year long shutdown, and they changed that in early february to a 18-24 month run and year long shutdown.
T2 13 jimpop : I, for one, think they are just scared of being blamed for 2012. :-
T2 14 Anonymous1 : ...at least according to the article at the end of the supplied link.
T2 15 Anonymous1 : Quoting a Prof. Brian Cox, "ALL particle accelerators have 6 - 12 month regular shutdowns for maintenance and upgrades.
T2 16 Anonymous1 : That's how complex machines are operated!
T2 17 Anonymous1 : "Now, I know slashdot readers don't read the articles, and I've become accustomed to the editors not reading the articles, but this situation implies that even the submitter of the article didn't read the article.How is that even possible?Sounds like one of those recursive quantum anomalies the LHC is designed to unravel...
T2 18 Pojut : Much thanks to you, fellow poster!
T2 19 rubycodez : What this really means is that after scheduled maintenance of 2011 which now includes bolstering against quench damage, the LHC will be slowly brought to full power in 2012.
T2 20 rubycodez : Reaching full power at the end of 2012.
T2 21 rubycodez : December 2012.
T2 22 rubycodez : Need I say more?
T2 23 pz : As the linked article points out, this so-called news is just lazy journalism of a long-ago announced planned shutdown for routine maintenance and upgrading.This should never have made it to the front page here.
T2 24 pz : Is it too much to ask that the editors at Slashdot at least GLANCE at the linked articles?
T2 25 0racle : Then they're doing it wrong.
T2 26 0racle : They're going to shutdown late 2011 for about a year.
T2 27 0racle : That means they should be up and running again around ......... December 2012   Be afraid.
T3 28 0racle : Gordon, you're needed in the experiment room.
T3 29 circletimessquare : the usual saboteurs from the future, trying to preserving their pathetic little doomed timeline
T3 30 Anonymous2 : Now we need someone to pipe up that if they used Agile Methodology when building the LHC, none of the design issues would have happened.
T4 31 Anonymous3 : it were a foreseen construction mistake.
T4 32 tomp1000 : quite frankly i'm so sick of people critisising the LHC, especially the people at fermilab.
T4 33 tomp1000 : firstly most people don;t know a damn thing about particle physics this includes me but I have a relative expert on hand to answer my queries unless you have some knowledge of beyond degree level particle physics or know someone who does quite well.
T4 34 tomp1000 : KEEP YOUR OPINION TO YOURSELF.
T4 35 tomp1000 : for those people probablly americans stop critising the LHC becuase its bigger than the accelerator at fermilab.
T4 36 tomp1000 : thats like kids arguing over who has a better skateboard.
T4 37 tomp1000 : NOT IMPORTANT
T4 38 Anonymous4 : It's one of the world's most ambitious projects.
T4 39 Anonymous4 : Not surprisingly, its construction and operation can be problematic from time to time.
T4 40 flagg9483 : I hear that a level in the next Duke Nukem will take place in LHC facility.
T4 41 flagg9483 : A PS3/360 trophy/achievement will be rewarded for finding the secret door to the main ring, repairing damage caused by mutated aliens, and escaping through a black hole created by incompetent CERN scientists.
T4 42 Monkeedude1212 : Actually, we've taken George Lucas' idea of a Death Star and built a giant Laser producing facility on the crust of our planet.
T4 43 Monkeedude1212 : Some minor set backs, of course, but we will have the power to destroy an entire planet soon enough.
T4 44 Monkeedude1212 : This whole "Quantum Physics" thing was just to get all the physicists on board, since most of them actually favour Star Trek.
T4 45 Anonymous5 : Prepare for unforeseen consequences.

T4 47 gestalt\_n\_pepper : Man, this is worse than last night's "Lost" episode.
T4 48 binarylarry : Resonance Cascade.
T4 49 Anonymous6 : ""The standard phrase is that the LHC is its own prototype," Dr. Steve Myers, director of the particle smasher, told the BBC today.
T4 50 Anonymous6 : "Due to an unforeseen construction mistake"...Wind it up to 11, guys!
T4 51 Anonymous6 : What could possibly go wrong?
T4 52 theshowmecanuck : Given the way Agile is usually implemented, it would have then made a detour under London before making it back to Switzerland.
T4 53 theshowmecanuck : Kind of like the famous cartoon wordpress.com... especially the documentation part.
T4 54 theshowmecanuck : Nice legs...
T4 55 Anonymous7 : It will be late 2012 before the LHC gets to full power?
T4 56 Anonymous7 : Hmmmmmmmm.... Awfully forboding to me.
T4 57 Anonymous8 : It may be due to semantics, but the headline is still inappropriate.
T4 58 Anonymous8 : I interpreted "shut down" as "dismantling," as if it were used in "shut down the NASA space program.
T4 59 Anonymous8 : " The summary clarifies the issue without sadisticly making you RTFA for it, but the heart attack has already happened.Well, news sources normally do this.
T4 60 Anonymous8 : It's just important to remember to never take anything as real unless you've read it AND cross referenced it thoroughly.
T4 61 Anonymous8 : Coming to slashdot does not count as a control-making space: cross-references usually mean talking with people who have the same belief, unless you're browsing at low thresholds or some dissenter post is modded insightful by luck.
T4 62 oracleofbargth : I know, I wouldn't want to be blamed for that movie either.
T4 63 istartedi : How long do we have before it goes further back and destroys humanity?
T4 64 istartedi : At least until yesterday.
T4 65 hoggoth : Once again, the timestream moves to protect itself.
T4 66 hoggoth : If they continue attempting to create Higgs-Boson particles at the LHC, we will find ourselves inhabiting an increasingly unlikely reality.
T4 67 hoggoth : Construction accidents, birds dropping baguettes into the particle beam, anything can happen to prevent this.Mark my word, something improbable will happen to the LHC near the end of this repair work.We should harness this power to direct the future time stream and create a drive that uses these disturbed probabilities.
T4 68 hoggoth : We can call it the 'improbability drive'.
T4 69 PinchDuck : Then it will never stop.
T4 70 Lord_Lode : That means 18 months of experiments at the highest particle accelerator power ever!
T4 71 Lord_Lode : Isn't that exciting?Who is most likely to find the Higgs boson then?
T4 72 Lord_Lode : The LHC, or the Tevatron?
T4 73 superzerg : The design energy for LHC particles is 7TeV, which means 17TeV energy in center of mass during collision.
T4 74 superzerg : The planned particles energy is 3.5TeV until 2011 which make 7TeV in center of mass.
T4 75 Anonymous9 : Wow you're an idiot.
T4 76 Anonymous9 : Am I also not allowed to criticize Iraq war because I don't have a degree in military history, or the Federal budget because I don't have a degree in economics?The headline says there was a construction "mistake".
T4 77 Anonymous9 : Not a design mistake, but a construction mistake; it seems perfectly reasonable to criticize that.
T4 78 Anonymous10 : Apparently by making the LHC work we will cause some disaster so time travelers from an alternate future make sure it stays broken so the disaster will not happen.

T4 89 Icaarus : From the Author's Website: follow the link that is the author's nameSlashdot  I guess I should just fess up and take the blame- I created Slashdot a long time ago, and now it seems to have grown into something pretty amazing.
T4 90 Icaarus : Come on down and check it out for news about Linux, Open Source Software, Legos, Games, Star Wars, Science, Technology and pretty much anything else that falls into the "News for Nerds, Stuff that Matters" umbrella.So we already know this lune does not know how to read, and that he just posts to flame-bait.
T4 91 Icaarus : Could it be that he also is a slanderous, wretched, troll who seeks to dishonour the nerds we covet.
T4 92 Icaarus : I would prefer to think that then to think that the creator of this website is in fact an illiterate fabulist.
T4 93 Icaarus : If the above quote is false, I say /.
T4 94 Icaarus : should sue the poster.
T4 95 Icaarus : If the above quote is true I say we should all boycott that which has been mutated by its own author beyond recognition.
T4 96 Anonymous13 : As a physicist, all I can say is we've been asking for this kind of press.When you hype the bejeezus out of the shiny new multi-billion dollar tool, it's reasonable for the people who paid for it to expect results.
T5 97 Anonymous13 : It is jarring when people hear for over a decade about the great results that will come out of an experiment, and then later hear that we have to spend ~50\% of the time doing maintenance on the equipment, and the first few years just testing it.
T5 98 Anonymous13 : I know this is the way things work, this is the way my much, much smaller experiments work.
T5 99 Anonymous13 : This is not a complaint about the science, or being careful.
T5 100 Anonymous13 : This is a complaint about politics, funding structures and a lack of ability across fields to communicate effectively with the general public.
T5 101 Anonymous13 : We can't keep doing this to ourselves if we want the public to trust us.
T5 102 Anonymous13 : We have to manage the media better.To begin with, the great achievement of the LHC *is* the LHC, not the search for the Higgs boson.
T5 103 Anonymous13 : It's enough that this is the most complicated, impressive, advanced piece of technology on the planet, and that it required input at the cutting edge from nearly every major field of physics.

T6 109 Anonymous15 : Just like westerners have periods of a thousand years millennium or a hundred years century, the Mayans have periods of 144,000 years.
T6 110 Anonymous15 : The Mayan calendar refers to events well after the beginning of the new b'ak'tun so this whole doomsday prophecy is basically on the same level of New Age bs as y2k.See: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maya\_calendar
T6 111 Anonymous16 : Is a four letter word around the LHC.
T6 112 Anonymous17 : Obviously the effect which is stopping the LHC from operating works by propagating a "ripple" back in time.
T6 113 Anonymous17 : Hence, the article summary WAS accurate at the time of submission, but then the ripple reached January and made the shutdown part of the original plan.
T6 114 Anonymous17 : It all makes sense!

T6 119 gestalt\_n\_pepper : Does this mean we're gradually increasing improbability in the universe?
T6 120 gestalt\_n\_pepper : This would *so* explain Microsoft Windows.
T6 121 argent : It's pretty obvious that what's happening is that every time they start it up at full power, it collapses the false vacuum and instantly destroys the universe.
T6 122 argent : So the only versions of the state vector we can observe are the ones in which the LHC never ramps up all the way, because we've been destroyed in the rest of them...
T6 123 Anonymous18 : Dont worry.
T6 124 Anonymous18 : The Fermi works very well and will continue to workHowever, I cant see why would you deem "secure" a work envirnoment that subjects you to gigantic and powerful electromagnetic fields plus you are confined quite in the same location as some really interesting radioactive material.For a physic, barring actual spacewalking, its about as hardcore as it gets.

T7 150 earlymon : Why?   It's called freedom of speech - perhaps you've heard of it.You certainly seem to think that you have it, by virtue of the protocols you've issued.News flash - since the beginning of time people have freely expressed opinion without regard for fact - and this is never more true than when the speaker is convinced that they are expressing facts.
T7 151 earlymon : Now, I wasn't around at the beginning of time, so far as I recall, but it's my opinion that that behavior has been occurring for at least that long and is therefore neither limited to Americans nor to Fermilab fans.My other opinion is that you're probably upset that Fermilab isn't in Europe and that you're simply jealous that you're missing out on all the fun.But you are providing plenty - for me anyway.
T7 152 earlymon : This snippet is simply priceless:quite frankly i'm so sick of people critisising the LHC, especially the people at fermilab.
T7 153 earlymon : firstly most people don;t know a damn thing about particle physics...Uh - ok - would those be the people at Fermilab that don't know a damn thing?BTW - my skateboard has something like 300 BHP, a gazillion ft-lbs of torque, and gets 21 miles per gallon when cruising at just over 100 miles per hour, when cruising that way for about 2 to 2.5 hours at a stretch.
T7 154 earlymon : And as soon as I translate a gazillion ft-lbs into SI, I'll get back to you on what that means - or - I'll just wait for an opinion from Illinois on that.Meanwhile, in my opinion, this sounds pretty cool:http://www.fnal.gov/pub/today/archive\_2010/today10-03-10Column\_readmore.html fnal.govAnd almost finally, in my opinion, I deserve extra crunchy mod points just for avoiding the whole bigger vs. keeping it up line of jokes in response to your post which given that there is NO NEWS in TFA, makes your complaint even funnier.NOT IMPORTANTThat's the worst sig ever.

T9 174 IICV : That's not how it works at all - we only experience the realities in which the LHC hasn't destroyed reality.
T9 175 IICV : All other realities have been destroyed, so we're not around to experience them.
T9 176 IICV : No timestream editing required.That's also why you aren't dead - you are not around to experience all of the realities in which you are dead, so you never will.On a more rational note: in order for unlikely events to happen, you need time and space.
T9 177 IICV : The more space you have, the less time it takes for something unlikely to happen in that space.
T9 178 IICV : The LHC is an incredibly delicate, incredibly closely monitored, extremely large thing there's 17 miles of some of the highest tech stuff ever in there.
