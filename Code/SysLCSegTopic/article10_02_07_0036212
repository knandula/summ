T1 1 kdawson : tcd004 writes "Wilson Bentley began photographing snowflakes in 1885, and managed to immortalize more than 5,000 crystals before his death in 1931.
T1 2 kdawson : Now his images are widely recognized and highly sought after.
T1 3 kdawson : At the age of 19, 'Snowflake' Bentley jury-rigged a microscope to a bulky bellows camera and took the first-ever photograph of a snowflake.
T1 4 kdawson : Photography then, particularly microphotography, was much closer to science than art.
T1 5 kdawson : In a 1910 article published in the journal Technical World, he wrote, 'Here is a gem bestrewn realm of nature possessing the charm of mystery, of the unknown, sure richly to reward the investigator.
T1 6 kdawson : " The video embedded at the link above touches on another long-forgotten piece of history: a sketch of the photographers who captured arial views of assemblages of tens of thousands of soldiers returning from WW-I, carefully choreographed and arranged to form a Liberty Bell, a Stature of Liberty, a US flag... as forgotten as the origin of the WW-I term razzle-dazzle.

T2 19 Anonymous5 : Maybe tomorrow we can hear about Charles Dickens.
T2 20 AtomicSnarl : For those wondering how wild colors and stripes on ships would hide them from U-Boats -- it didn't.
T2 21 AtomicSnarl : It made it hard for the U-Boat captains to properly evaluate their targets.
T2 22 AtomicSnarl : The colors and pattern would disrupt the length, angle, and speed clues seen though binoculars at a distance, and through the periscope when preparing to fire torpedoes.
T2 23 AtomicSnarl : Radar didn't exist during WWI, so U-Boats cruised on the surface with lookouts who could eyeball ships or ship smoke at 10 miles, maybe 20 on a good day.
T2 24 AtomicSnarl : Given their 15-18 knot surface speed k12.nc.us and 6-8 knot submerged speed, the U-Boat now had only 30 minutes or so to get into proper position ahead of the approaching ship -- about 4000-6000 yards 2-3 nautical miles ahead and to one side of the approaching target.
T2 25 AtomicSnarl : WWI German torpedoes wikipedia.org could travel 6600 yards at 36 knots, for a max run time of just over 5 minutes.
T2 26 AtomicSnarl : A target ship moving at 12 knots would move 400 yards in a minute.
T2 27 AtomicSnarl : A 600 foot ship travels it's length in only 30 seconds.
T2 28 AtomicSnarl : It's this tiny window that the Razzle-Dazzle would screw up.
T2 29 AtomicSnarl : If the U-Boat captain guessed wrong on the ships movement due to painted false bow waves and extra bow/stern lines, the firing solution would be bad.
T2 30 AtomicSnarl : Remember that the ship view from the U-Boat was usually against cloudy skies of some sort in the North Atlantic.
T3 31 AtomicSnarl : Add in the blue haze with distance, and the yellows, purples, and pinks start to blur into the background blue-gray sky.
T3 32 AtomicSnarl : Now think of that sight through a wet periscope a few feet above the water, and you get the idea.
T3 33 AtomicSnarl : WWII had a brilliant camoufalge example in the bizarre sounding Pink Spitfires airplane-pictures.net used for reconnaissance ipmsstockholm.org.
T3 34 AtomicSnarl : The pink shade was selected to blend against the just-past-sunset twilight sky and clouds when those aircraft flew, and it was very effective.

T6 55 Phat\_Tony : In the linked video, at 1:44 the narrator says Gallileo said "I'm only as good as those shoulders I've stood on before," which nearly had me rolling around on the floor laughing.
T6 56 Phat\_Tony : I think he's trying to reference Newton's statement "If I have been able to see further than others, it is because I have stood on the shoulders of giants.

T6 66 Anonymous12 : It's said that no flake is equal to another, which is amazing de per se.But I'm intrigued by the constant symmetry.I can understand crystals and why they form natural patterns, like prisms or cubes, but given that everyone is different why an arm or leg is equal to the other?
T6 67 Anonymous12 : Maybe they form together hence they grow identical and then split somehow?Any geologist or spelunker in the room?
T6 68 lenroc : I don't really think Snowflake Bentley has been "long forgotten", as the summary implies.
T6 69 lenroc : Our homeschooled children just finished a unit study on him a few weeks ago which doesn't prove anything of course except that he's still well known enough for there to be unit studies made available on him....In fact, a book about him, appropriately titled Snowflake Bentley amazon.com won the Caldecott medal as recently as 1999!

T6 72 couchslug : "Pink" and "broken outlines" still works, note that Stealth aircraft are black to appeal to aircrew.
T6 73 couchslug : Black isn't optimal for the night ops required by stealth systems, which is why WWII night fighters were often a lighter color.Factory stealth camo:http://www.fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/ac/f-117-camo.jpg fas.org
T6 74 siride : No, "thy" is quite correct here, although "sayeth" isn't.
T6 75 siride : The singular imperative quite boringly had no ending in Early Modern English or late Middle Engish -- whichever the OP was going for.
T6 76 siride : "Thine" was the original form, and over time came only to be used before words starting with a vowel or when standing alone as "mine" still is and "thy", a shortened form, was used before consonants and eventually took over as the sole adjectival form as "my" still is.
T6 77 Anonymous14 : I read about this once.
T6 78 Anonymous14 : Basically the shape of a snowflake is determined by the exact conditions over the course of the formation of the snowflake.
T6 79 Anonymous14 : This is why finding two identical snowflakes is so unlikely.
T6 80 Anonymous14 : That being said, apparently the vast majority of snow flakes aren't symmetrical.
T6 81 Anonymous14 : It's just that they aren't pretty so no one posts pictures of them.
T6 82 Anonymous14 : According to this site  run by a Caltech physics prof, its got amazing info and pictures of snowflakes, "The most common snow crystals by far are the irregular crystals.
T6 83 Anonymous14 : These are small, usually clumped together, and show little of the symmetry seen in stellar or columnar crystals.
T6 84 Anonymous14 : "In any case, the reason for the "perfect" symmetry that you can find it, "As the crystal becomes larger, however,  branches begin to sprout from the six corners of the hexagon this is the third stage in the diagram at right.
T6 85 Anonymous14 : Since the atmospheric conditions e. g. temperature and humidity are nearly constant across the small crystal, the six budding arms all grow out at roughly the same rate.

T7 87 Yo\_mama : In addition to the pink spitfires, there were pink ships: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountbatten\_pink wikipedia.org WikipediaA couple of the photos in the "razzle dazzle" article were of WWII ships and not WWI as implied.
T7 88 Yo\_mama : Razzle Dazzle itself was not an official term used by the US Navy and I don't believe the Royal Navy either, albeit I'm less sure of that.
T7 89 Black_Parrot : Fans of old photos should look up the classic survey of the San Francisco earthquake, which were taken by kite-borne cameras.Oh, and Linux fans will want to check out S.S. War Penguin at the razzle-dazzle link.
T7 90 Tom_DBA : A microphotograph is a very small photo.
T8 91 Tom_DBA : Like the micro dots spys used to send under postage stamps or the flaps of envelopes.
T8 92 Tom_DBA : A photomicrograph is a photo taken through a microscope.
T8 93 Tom_DBA : I think he took photomicrographs or micrographs.
T8 94 penguinchris : Bentley donated the original glass plates to the Buffalo Museum of Science a city known for snow itself, though Bentley did most of his work in Vermont as far as I know.
T8 95 penguinchris : They have many of them scanned, and include data about each photo as well.
T8 96 penguinchris : See it here.
T8 97 penguinchris : sciencebuff.orgI'm from Buffalo and have been to the museum countless times; after learning about Bentley I am always amazed that they don't capitalize on it with some sort of exhibit.
T8 98 penguinchris : Seems like it would be a nice attraction to a museum that otherwise seems to be having trouble encouraging attendance and keeping up the collections.
T8 99 drinkypoo : I imagine there's a number of slashdotters who can afford an "escort" like that.

T9 104 dugeen : No doubt this material would have been of enormous use to poor Dr Max Box and his quest for two identical snowflakes.
T9 105 Anonymous16 : They truly are beautiful.
T9 106 Anonymous16 : I have a collection that has been handed down to me, and I can tell you first-hand that they are very intricate and detailed - and each is one of a kind; some very beautiful, and others not so attractive but still incredible to look at.
