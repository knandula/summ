T1 1 timothy : The Installer writes with this selection from GizMag: "Walking quadrupeds are being cast to play a major role in the rapidly unfolding age of robotics.
T1 2 timothy : The platform promises versatility far beyond that of wheeled-vehicles and will undoubtedly find applications in a wide variety of fields.
T1 3 timothy : Not surprisingly, the development of quadrupeds is being driven by the military and DARPA has recently boosted its efforts by awarding Boston Dynamics $32 million for the prototype phase of its Legged Squad Support System (LS3) program.
T1 4 timothy : ... LC3 is conceived as an autonomous support pack-robot for ground troops that can carry 400 pounds or more of payload, sustain itself for 24 hours and cover 20 miles in almost any kind of terrain.
T1 5 Anonymous1 : I for one welcome our AT-AT overlords.
T1 6 Anonymous2 : So it begins....
T1 7 Anonymous3 : Wouldn't six be more stable, distribute weight better, and be more redundant in case of failure of a limb?
T1 8 Anonymous3 : The only advantages I can think of to four is better efficiency maybe?
T1 9 Anonymous3 : Having to move fewer limbs should be a plus, but on the other hand they'll each also have to be more powerful and a slightly more compact form.
T1 10 Anonymous3 : Is it worth it?
T1 11 Anonymous3 : I'd certainly find a couple extra limbs convenient; you'd think a military robot in potentially harsh conditions would also find a couple spares very useful.

T1 13 iamhassi : Guess no t1000, sounds like we need to worry about robotic mr Ed:  "I'll be back Wilbur"
T1 14 goldaryn : ?Extra limbs are a whole extra level of complexity in terms of limb control and present extra vulnerabilities as well as extra benefits.
T1 15 goldaryn : Like with anything, limbs present diminishing returns; millions of years of evolution has settled on 4 limbs as a good number for a large land creature.
T1 16 goldaryn : Or, if you prefer "God made it that way".
T1 17 goldaryn : Or, "4 legs GOOD, 6 legs BAD"

T1 24 immaterial : Well, was there a time when vertebrates ever had six limbs?
T1 25 immaterial : I thought we'd just happened to pop out of the water that way; given that we vertebrates have all kept our basic layout since then, I wouldn't really say evolution ever had the opportunity to try six limbs on a large land creature.
T1 26 immaterial : Obviously more legs doesn't necessarily mean better.
T1 27 immaterial : Why not eight, like the last guy said?
T1 28 immaterial : There's an advantage to redundancy but like you said there are disadvantages as well.
T1 29 immaterial : It just seems to me like six would be a happier medium between the two.
T1 30 immaterial : You need three points on the ground to remain relatively stable without getting into balance issues.
T1 31 immaterial : Of course a good robot could balance itself on two - hell even a Segway can do it - but lets say in a complex situation like trying to climb a steep rocky hill in Afghanistan in a hurry you want as much stability as possible note a person in that situation will be using their hands for additional stability too.
T1 32 immaterial : To move while doing that requires at least one more limb, for a total of four.
T1 33 immaterial : If there is have a failure in just one limb, you've reduced the robot's stability by quite a bit.
T1 34 immaterial : I just seems to me like six would be worth it in varied terrain - I mean, if all you're going to do is bound across the plains all day like a gazelle the extra limbs may not be useful, but I'm imagining these things in more steep, mountainous areas as well, where extra footing could be a huge asset.

T4 62 Patch86 : Over the course of billions of years, most designs have been given a chance at competing in most areas.I don't think it can be a coincidence, completely outside of the mechanics of evolution, that more than 4 legs are prolific in small animals crabs and large bugs at the largest while most larger animals have gone for 4 or less.
T4 63 Patch86 : Arguing that this has absolutely nothing to do with natural selection would be a difficult standpoint.

T8 92 DoninIN : 4 Limbs is a good number, I'm not going to dispute that part.

T9 106 Nivag064 : Also as you have said, it would make it easier to cope with rugged terrain.I think that normally 8 would be overkill, also more legs are not necessarily be better as they would have to be lighter and more easily damaged by enemy activity.
T9 107 Nivag064 : However, I think 4 legs is too few.I have thought about this problem on and off since I was about 6, when I saw a picture of a six legged vehicle and wondered how it moved.
T9 108 myocardialinfarction : Four legs good, two legs bad.
T9 109 myocardialinfarction : The government enjoyed riffing on 1984 so much they've started on Animal Farm.
T9 110 Animats : No, four legs are better for a large machine.
T9 111 Animats : There's a tradeoff between leg working envelope, vehicle length, and top speed.
T9 112 Animats : There was a big fad for six-legged insect robots in the 1990s, led by Rod Brooks at MIT.
T9 113 Animats : Those were very slow, very dumb, and had a very wide stance.
T9 114 Animats : Six legs don't scale up well.
T9 115 Animats : One big issue is inertia.
T9 116 Animats : Double the dimensions of something, and it gets four times as strong strength comes from cross-section but eight times as massive mass comes from volume.
T9 117 Animats : This is called the cube-square law, and it's why there are no giant insects.
T9 118 Animats : For small creatures,
T9 119 Animats : forces like surface tension matter, but inertia doesn't.
T9 120 Animats : For large, fast ones, inertia dominates.
T9 121 Animats : Before dynamic balance was figured out, robots tended to have very wide stances, and some had too many legs.
T9 122 Animats : DARPA built funded the Adaptive Suspension Vehicle amazon.com at Ohio State in the 1980s.
T9 123 Animats : 28 feet long, six legs, seats one, no cargo capacity.
T9 124 Animats : Top speed 3-5 MPH on flat ground.
T9 125 Animats : At least three legs were on the ground at all times, and often four, five, or six.
T9 126 Animats : The gaits were very conservative.
T9 127 Animats : It was supposed to be off-road capable, but that part never worked.
T9 128 Animats : A sloping road was as far as they got.
T9 129 Animats : There was some computer control, but the thing was mostly driven by an onboard driver, using three joysticks.
T9 130 Animats : With dynamic balance and traction control, the leg geometry doesn't have to be as conservative.
T9 131 Animats : BigDog's leg geometry is four legs with three joints each, a narrow stance, and control which allows the leg envelopes to overlap.
T9 132 Animats : This is close to the layout of the larger
T9 133 Animats : quadrupeds.
T9 134 Animats : BigDog has the size and weight of a medium pony; it's bigger than dog-size.
T9 135 Animats : With four legs and a long body, pitch stability isn't too hard, but roll stability requires active control.
T9 136 Animats : The faster quadrupedal mammals have very narrow stances; a horse's track is less than a foot wide, narrower than its body.
T9 137 Animats : BigDog doesn't track quite that narrow, but it gets close.
T9 138 Animats : The narrow track makes tight turns possible, and allows sudden changes in yaw when needed for slip recovery or collision avoidance.
T9 139 Animats : With dynamic balance and slip control, the speed can be cranked up.
T9 140 Animats : The six-legged machines mostly crawled; the modern four-legged machines trot, and some run.
T9 141 Animats : The usual running gaits, the ones with a moment of suspension, for a quadruped are the trot, pronk, rotatory gallop, and canter.
T9 142 Animats : BigDog can trot and pronk; it may be able to do a rotatory gallop.
T9 143 Animats : That's the real reason to go with four legs.
T9 144 Animats : Six legs just get in the way at speed.
T9 145 Animats : BigDog's three-joint leg animats.com isn't mentioned much, but the third joint lets the control system adjust the ground contact force vector to stay within the friction cone, without changing the
T9 146 Animats : foot position.
T9 147 Animats : This is a big win when climbing hills, and the hind end needs to come under the body.
T9 148 Animats : It's all about the control algorithms.
T9 149 Animats : Don't let the legs collide, prevent slip, recover from slip, support the body, maintain roll balance, provide propulsion, avoid obstacles, stay on course, accomplish the mission.
T9 150 Animats : Those are the priorities.
T9 151 Animats : If you want to understand the theory behind BigDog, read Didier Papadoupolis's thesis martinbuehler.net, "Stable Running for a Quadruped Robot with Compliant Legs".
T9 152 Animats : The technology for BigDog came from Martin Buehler's lab at McGill University.
T9 153 Animats : Buehler himself quit McGill and went to work for Boston Dynamics as the chief engineer on BigDog.
T9 154 Animats : Once BigDog worked, he went to iRobot.
T9 155 Animats : The theory is out there in the literature.
T9 156 Animats : Some of it is mine.
T9 157 AmericanInKiev : Uh, Evolution has had plenty of experience with hexapods spiders and a plethra of arrangements, some less than symmetrical crabs.Very often, extra limbs are more valuable for manipulating food, than for motivation and become "arms", "claws", etc...I'll bet they could have offered a prize of 1/10th that amount and got 10 better designs.
T9 158 AmericanInKiev : except a camel can go several days... and live off the land.
