T1 1 ScuttleMonkey : ssv03 writes "The New York Times is reporting that Chase Community Giving of Chase Bank recently held a contest on Facebook in which users were encouraged to vote for their favorite charities.
T1 2 ScuttleMonkey : At the end of the contest, the 100 charities with the most votes would win $25,000 and advance to the next round to have a chance to win $1 million.
T1 3 ScuttleMonkey : Initially, the vote counts for each organization were made public, but two days before voting ended they were hidden, and the final totals have still not been released.
T1 4 ScuttleMonkey : While Chase had no official leader board during the voting, several organizations were keeping track of projected winners.
T1 5 ScuttleMonkey : Those projections were almost identical to the final results, yet several organizations including Students for Sensible Drug Policy (SSDP), Marijuana Policy Project and several anti-abortion groups were not finalists.
T1 6 ScuttleMonkey : They had been performing very well (some within the top 20) until the vote counters were removed.
T1 7 ScuttleMonkey : Chase Bank has so far refused to discuss the issue with the organizations.
T1 8 ScuttleMonkey : SSDP has spoken out in a press release (PDF) and is calling for a boycott.

T4 26 Jojoba86 : In what ways are these charities?
T4 27 Jojoba86 : I thought charity is about giving to people in need, not supporting political organisations.
T4 28 Anonymous3 : Students for Sensible Drug Policy SSDP, Marijuana Policy Project and several anti-abortion groups don't sound like very charitable organizations.
T4 29 Anonymous3 : They sound like political groups that may be non-profit.
T4 30 CRCulver : Many organizations in the US that push for policy changes are federally registered as 501c3 charities.
T4 31 gzipped\_tar : I thought "charities" in the US were about agendas with a tax deduction.
T4 32 gzipped\_tar : Then again, I'm not an American, so I may be wrong.
T4 33 Anonymous4 : In what ways are these charities?
T4 34 Anonymous4 : I thought charity is about giving to people in need, not supporting political organisations.Plenty of anti-abortion groups are about helping and educating pregnant women, not advancing political change.
T4 35 Anonymous4 : Anti-abortion doesn't always mean anti-choice as strange as it sounds.
T4 36 Anonymous4 : The MPP probably believe they're helping glaucoma patients.
T4 37 Anonymous4 : I don't know what the SSDP does.
T4 38 Anonymous5 : Obviously Chase meant the top "non-embarassing to a big company" charities.
T4 39 Anonymous5 : Can you imagine if Chase had to donate $1M to the Marijuana Policy Project?
T4 40 Anonymous5 : I'm sure the board freaked out at the thought of "chase" and "MJ" being in the same sentence and said, "do whatever is necessary to make sure we don't get that association.
T4 41 Anonymous6 : The reason a corporation give money to a charity isn't because it believes in the charity, but because it will get a blurb in paper saying how good they are and increase the brand good will.
T4 42 Anonymous6 : Does anyone really expect a corporation to spend $25000 so it can be on the news with a headline "Chase supports legalizing Drugs".
T4 43 Anonymous6 : I won't even get to the quagmire around abortion.
T4 44 Anonymous6 : I'm sure if they do this again, they'll pre-screen organizations that are allowed to participate.
T4 45 Anonymous6 : Frankly I'd been more concerned if they screened out an organization that helps people get out of credit card debt.
T4 46 Culture20 : In both of those cases, you can be sure that they'd get plenty of blurbs in every news medium.
T4 47 Culture20 : They're getting blurbs now, but it's being tied to how secretive they are with money.
T4 48 Culture20 : Not sure I want to bank with them.
T4 49 kurt555gs : " I am altering the deal, pray that I do not alter it any further ".Banks, Ugh!
T4 50 Anonymous7 : The people who are voting for the drug organizations are idiots who need to put down the bong for long enough to see that there are other human being starving and dying and suffering.
T4 51 Anonymous7 : The thought that people are putting the legalization of a recreational drug over say giving somebody a hot meal sickens me.
T4 52 Psyborgue : The fact that so many people are imprisoned or have otherwise have their lives ruined by the great war against drugs self ownership sickens me.
T4 53 Psyborgue : Chase chose to put up a vote to determine what people believe sickens them most.
T4 54 Psyborgue : Who are you or Chase to interfere?
T4 55 maxume : I often masturbate instead of thinking of the hungry.
T4 56 KazW : The thought that people are putting the legalization of a recreational drug over say giving somebody a hot meal sickens me.While throwing someone in prison for smoking or growing something completely natural, destroys their credibility, severely affects their ability to get most jobs and ruins their life isn't such a problem with you?
T4 57 KazW : I'm not saying people who are starving are unimportant, far from it, but to say that it's simply a matter of a recreational drug is pure ignorance on your part, and it is you who sickens me.
T4 58 evanbd : And the thought of people's lives being ruined over doing something that did no harm to anyone doesn't sicken you?
T4 59 jirka : That's the problem with democracy.
T4 60 jirka : People might vote for something you don't like.
T4 61 jirka : This is a lesson that many dictators learned the hard way and solved in the same way as Chase.
T4 62 jirka : It's really better to start cheating from the very start and just pretend people are actually voting.
T4 63 quarrelinastraw : there are other human being starving and dying and sufferingYeah, like the many people  dead or wounded due to gang violence fueled by the street drug trade, or the many people addicted to drugs who can't get medical or treatment help because they will get arrested or simply ignored, the people dying in Afghanistan and Iraq due to terrorist groups funded largely by the heroin trade.
T4 64 quarrelinastraw : I could go on, but you're an idiot if you think the current US policy toward narcotics doesn't cause starving, dying and suffering.
T4 65 quarrelinastraw : People who think caring about drug policy is for bong-toting fratboys sicken me.
T4 66 Anonymous8 : The thought that people are putting giving someone a hot meal over say giving a good professional education sickens me.The fact is that most of the people whose lives have been destroyed by drug-related arrests are not bored college kids looking for recreation.
T4 67 Anonymous8 : If your dad is rich enough your arrest will be stricken off police records.

T4 69 Anonymous8 : If you are poor you'll get a rap sheet that will haunt you forever.Disclaimer: I have never used drugs, not even marijuana.

T4 71 Anonymous9 : That's precisely what pisses a lot of us off!
T4 72 Anonymous9 : Our society is currently spending untold $billions right now harassing potheads who are hurting no one but themselves.
T4 73 Anonymous9 : We could and should be using those resources to help those who are starving, dying, and suffering.
T4 74 Anonymous10 : All being registered as a 501c means is that you are a non profit/not for profit, it has nothing to do with whether or not you are a charity.
T4 75 Idiomatick : Which is weird because if they came in first then clearly the people are ok with it.... /shrugs/ I don't get the logic.
T5 76 duncan : Wow, a credit card company changing the rules in the middle of the game.How Shocking!
T5 77 ModernGeek : Those non profit get out of debt corporations are just collection agencies for the credit card companies.
T5 78 ModernGeek : I'd be
T5 79 ModernGeek : even more concerned if one of those won the contest.
T5 80 ModernGeek : Imagine how good it would look for them as they evaded taxes, got great PR, free advertising, and collected old debts all at once.
T5 81 Anonymous11 : Can you imagine if Chase had to donate $1M to the Marijuana Policy Project?That's even more difficult to imagine than a Rage Against The Machine song topping the charts at Christmas.
T5 82 Anonymous11 : Oh wait bit.ly...
T6 83 drew30319 : I run a 501c3 that I formed in 2006.
T6 84 drew30319 : My organization was also in the running for the Chase Contest but was not one of the winners.
T6 85 drew30319 : While disappointed, I'm pleased that Chase undertook this contest using this approach.
T6 86 drew30319 : Generally corporate contests and donations go to the large charities; Chase at least gave us a chance.
T7 87 drew30319 : Following is the IRS information on being a 501c3; note that the first paragraph states "...it may not be an action organization, i.e., it may not attempt to influence legislation as a substantial part of its activities..."Exemption Requirements - Section 501c3 Organizations
T7 88 drew30319 : To be tax-exempt under section 501c3 of the Internal Revenue Code, an organization must be organized and operated exclusively for exempt purposes set forth in section 501c3, and none of its earnings may inure to any private shareholder or individual.

T7 98 Anonymous12 : stop doing your banking with these mega corporations.You keep empowering them everytime you put your money into them.I'm not saying hide your money under your bed or in your backyard, just stop doing business with these megacorporations.
T7 99 Anonymous13 : My first thought was "hey, if you set up a vote like that, you've gotta accept it if people happen to like, say, pro-marijuana projects" and then I saw "anti-abortion groups", at which point I was thinking "obviously they can't fund religious nut-job terrorists.
T7 100 Anonymous13 : " Then I realized that I was being a hypocrite, and I'm still sorting through the cognitive dissonance fall-out.
T7 101 oscarwumpus : ...taste better after a little sensible drug use.
T7 102 oscarwumpus : Allegedly.
T7 103 electrosoccertux : I think it's odd they felt the same way about a group of people that don't want dead what will one day otherwise become a child in the real world.
T7 104 frozentier : If this is simply Chase giving money - their own money - to a charity, they can legally give it to whoever they want.
T7 105 frozentier : It might be different if this was a lottery and the organizations had money invested, but they don't.
T7 106 frozentier : This is just a popularity contest.
T7 107 frozentier : If you're a finalist on American Idol, you're in the top 3, and they decide to boot you off the show because they find out you used to use pot, then you're shit out of luck, you know?
T7 108 frozentier : If Chase decided "screw it, we're not giving money to anyone", they have a right to do that.
T7 109 Alsee : Can you imagine if Chase had to donate $1M to the Marijuana Policy Project?
T7 110 Alsee : I'm sure the board freaked out at the thought of "chase" and "MJ" being in the same sentence and said, "do whatever is necessary to make sure we don't get that association.
T7 111 Alsee : "If Citibank were offering a free toaster for opening a new savings account, and Chase were offering an ounce bag of weed, I can sure as hell tell you it's not my bread that's going to be getting toasted.-
T7 112 antgly : I've always hated Chase, their fees, and etc.
T7 113 antgly : and this article isn't helping.
T7 114 Anonymous14 : Does anyone really expect a corporation to spend $25000 so it can be on the news with a headline "Chase supports legalizing Drugs".The alternative which they chose was headlines suggesting Chase can't be trusted to honor their commitments.
T7 115 Anonymous14 : This is a bank.
T7 116 Anonymous14 : Their other commitments include keeping peoples' money.
T7 117 Anonymous14 : What message does it send when they appear to not pay certain people contrary to previously-agreed rules?
T7 118 Ozlanthos : Given the vast disparity between the ill-effects of using marijuana, and the ill-effects induced by being incarcerated for mere "possession" of it, I'd have to put the rationalization of this country's marijuana laws far above most of what chase considers more "acceptable" use of it's charitable contributions.
T7 119 Ozlanthos : -Oz
T7 120 stoat : Just set the pile on fire to spite all crybabies.
T7 121 stoat : Then point to this thread when little johnny the orphan asks for new socks.

T7 125 RAMMS+EIN : isn't the only place on the Net where this is happening.
T7 126 crsuperman34 : Why would Chase be concerned with ignominy?
T7 127 crsuperman34 : Any charitable organization except those chase found to be exempt winning is purely fortuitous.
T7 128 crsuperman34 : The true commercial nature of this contest is adverse to the charitable benefits anways.
T7 129 nonsensical : Just realize the interest rate they're giving on Savings accounts is .01\%  not 1\% or a 10th of a percent, but a hundredth of a percent, practically zero.
T7 130 nonsensical : There is no incentive to save your money with chase.
T7 131 Caspian : Is this really surprising, people?
T7 132 Caspian : REALLY? They're just playing CYA.
T7 133 Caspian : Chase obviously doesn't want to step on any political "hot buttons" on either side of the aisle, so they're somewhat arbitrarily disqualifying charities affiliated with both "liberal" causes less restrictive laws on marijuana and "conservative" causes anti-abortion.
T7 134 Caspian : Although I'm sad to see the former disqualified, if it means one of my banks full disclosure: I am a Chase customer doesn't give money to some anti-choice lunatics, I'm happy.Chase might not have predicted that highly politically charged charities would make it into the top $foo list.
T7 135 Caspian : Not every charity is something everyone can get behind, like the Stop Grinding Baby Kittens Into Soup Foundation.
T7 136 Caspian : I will now stand back and wait for one of you knuckleheads to talk about how you support the grinding of baby kittens into soup...
T7 137 BitZtream : 501c3 is non-profit, charity and non-profit are not one and the same.

T8 150 Anonymous17 : Even after seeing their mistake?.
T8 151 Anonymous17 : Any other good card would call if their is a problem.
T8 152 Blakey_Rat : Non-profit != charity.Political action groups are registered as non-profits.

T9 161 Anonymous20 : Uh huh.
T9 162 Anonymous20 : " They have as much interest in charity as I have in another Bush regime.
T9 163 hesaigo999ca : Some cute intern probably came up with this great idea thinking it would be small time and had no real implications other then doing a good deed for some charity, and thought it would be down played.
T9 164 hesaigo999ca : Whether there was any "special" treatment to win the contest, I think definitely the person who thought this idea up, did not foresee the fact that make something visible right to the end, then make it invisible, would make it evidently problematic for them.
