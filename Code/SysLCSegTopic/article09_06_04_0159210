T1 1 samzenpus : Barence writes "Streaming will overtake download services to become the dominant force in the online music industry, according to industry insiders.
T1 2 samzenpus : The claim comes in the wake of the PRS cutting the amount of royalties streaming services have to pay songwriters to about a third.
T1 3 samzenpus : Sites will now pay the PRS 0.085p per track, compared to the 0.22p they paid previously.
T1 4 samzenpus : On-demand streaming services still have to pay the record labels about 1p for every track streamed, however.
T2 5 samzenpus : Steve Purdham, CEO of music service We7, says the move will accelerate the growing trend towards online streaming which has seen newcomers such as his site and Spotify attract millions of users in less than a year.
T2 6 samzenpus : 'Over the next 12-24 months you'll see a move towards listening [online],' Purdham told PC Pro.
T2 7 samzenpus : 'Why do you actually need to have something downloaded on your PC?
T2 8 samzenpus : The streaming idea is really the future.
T2 9 Anonymous1 : Sometimes, I want something to actually be MINE.
T2 10 Anonymous2 : '"idk, because you're not always connected to the internet?because possession is 9/10ths of ownership if it's not, it should be.
T2 11 Anonymous3 : I assume that one p means 0.01 UK pounds but I could be wrong about that.
T2 12 Anonymous4 : Can't load it onto your iPod.Unless you are tied to a PC all the time, or have a fancy-schmancy iPhone or touch, this idea won't be as universal as good old MP3/WMA/AAC.
T2 13 Anonymous5 : I have at least 5 different devices that cannot stream that I use weekly.
T2 14 Anonymous5 : Also why waste the bandwidth playing the same songs over and over again, yesterday I listened to almost 2 gigs of music and some days I might listen to 3-4x that amount when I listen to my 1980's punk FLAC-encoded albums.
T2 15 Anonymous5 : I use Comcast that would mean I would use 1/3-2/3 of my bandwidth per month just for background noise.
T2 16 El\_Muerte\_TDS : What do they know?
T2 17 El\_Muerte\_TDS : If there was some knowledge in the industry about the future we wouldn't have the mess we have right now.
T2 18 iVasto : I for one have used Spotify in the past.
T2 19 iVasto : I no longer use it because every couple weeks I had to hunt down a British proxy in order to log in--Spotify isn't available in the US yet, hence the proxy.
T2 20 iVasto : However for the two months I did use it, I loved it.
T2 21 iVasto : The music library is a decent size, the playlists work well, and it even has the ability to have collaborative playlists.
T2 22 iVasto : The creator of uTorrent, Ludvig Strigeus, is involved with Spotify.
T2 23 iVasto : Granted, Spotify did not stop me from downloading music due to needing to put music on my iPod, I did download a lot less during those months.
T2 24 iVasto : Spotify allowed me to listen to complete albums without needing to download first.
T2 25 iVasto : This resulted in me only downloading the albums I really wanted on my iPod.
T2 26 iVasto : Also, probably the most convienant part of Spotify was that I was able to set my laptop out at parties and people could add almost whatever song they could think of onto the playlist.
T2 27 iVasto : Spotify will not replace downloading, but I do believe that it will significantly reduce it.
T2 28 Max_Romantschuk : While I like my CD collection, I have to admit that Spotify is really really handy for casual listening.
T2 29 Max_Romantschuk : I have a jukebox of ridiculous proportions at my disposal, for the relatively cheap price of a few audio ads a day.
T2 30 Max_Romantschuk : Which I could also get rid of with the subscription option.
T2 31 Max_Romantschuk : Streaming has the additional benefit of making it impossible to lose / delete what you don't story anyway.
T2 32 Max_Romantschuk : I don't really think a lot of people will find the buying option very attractive once 3G cell phones acquire this ability... I'm waiting for Spotify for my phone, they already hired an S60 developer, but then again I live in Finland.
T2 33 Anonymous6 : You know, in a world without iPods - these insiders might be right.
T2 34 Anonymous6 : However that's not even remotely like the real world we live in.
T2 35 Anonymous6 : It does seem to bear a striking resemblance to the world U.S. cellphone company executives are trying to pretend we live in, though - that world where we pay them some amount of money to buy a service that duplicates what we can do for free without their hardware yeah, Verizon, I'm looking at YOU.I for one listen to a heck of a lot more music while I'm out and about than when I'm sitting at/near my computer.
T2 36 Anonymous6 : I realize I'm probably in the minority in that regard - but I think it's a safe bet that almost everyone that purchases music nowadays wants to listen to it on the go at least part of the time.
T2 37 Anonymous6 : Without ubiquitous, unlimited, cheap internet access that's not going to be music that's streamed.
T2 38 Anonymous7 : But as a consumer I sure as heck don't.
T2 39 Anonymous7 : Think of how bad DRM is, well add another layer and you got streaming media that is also DRM "protected", also add the need for an always on connection this works on my iPod how exactly?
T2 40 Anonymous7 : and I'm sure we have a winner!
T2 41 Anonymous7 : Remind me again why I shouldn't be swapping around 1 terabyte hard drives with my friends?
T2 42 noundi : The streaming idea is really the future.Wait a second.
T2 43 noundi : What goes for bandwidth issues that has been a hot topic lately regarding BitTorrent traffic, how will this be any better?
T2 44 noundi : If every song you hear through your PC is streamed, my guess is it would choke internet more than the current BitTorrent traffic.
T2 45 sarahbau : I didn't see what part of streaming is going to surpass digital downloads - shear data transfer, unique tracks transferred, money made, etc.
T2 46 sarahbau : I don't doubt that they'll transfer more data, since if someone wants to listen to a song 3 times in a week, they have to download it 3 times.
T2 47 sarahbau : Maybe even unique tracks will be higher, since people would be more likely to listen to a song they don't know if they'll like or not if they don't have to pay anything extra free or flat monthly fee.
T2 48 sarahbau : However I'm not sure streaming will pass the revenue of digital purchases any time soon.
T2 49 Anonymous8 : 'Why do you actually need to have something downloaded on your PC?
T2 50 Anonymous8 : The streaming idea is really the future.
T2 51 Anonymous8 : '"I don't have any numbers to back this up, but surely the majority of music is listened to off line at the moment, on mp3 players etc?
T2 52 Anonymous8 : The whole point of portable devices is that you aren't tethered to your PC to listen.For this to change, it needs to become much easier and cheaper for portable devices to stream music "on the go".Orlando
T2 53 will\_die : A person who owns and runs a streaming music site is saying that people will actually start using the system?
T2 54 will\_die : Please that is worse then the head of Government Motors saying that US citizens are going to purchase those small cars he wants to force on everyone.
T2 55 crafty.munchkin : Here in Australia we have these horrendously tight-arsed ISPs who charge us ridiculous amounts of money for bandwidth.
T2 56 crafty.munchkin : For my $70/month, I get 40gb of downloads and that's separated into 20gb peak and 20gb off-peak, on a 1.5mbps ADSL connection.
T2 57 crafty.munchkin : I'd easily listen to far more than 20gb of music in any given month.
T2 58 Anonymous9 : Unless they are going to start streaming lossless audio I have almost no interest in streamed music content.Sure, it might be fine when you don't have access to your music collection, but I have spent a lot on money on my audio hardware, there is no way I will be happy amplifying the crappy streamed mp3's or what ever compressed format a service chooses.If there are high quality lossless services out there, please let me know.
T2 59 William_Robinson : Few weeks back, my friend showed me how iPhone or something else from Apple.
T2 60 William_Robinson : identifies correct song and allows you to download by listening clip of a song from my mobile for few seconds.
T2 61 William_Robinson : The song I played was hardly 16kbps mp3 and sound quality must have been not so great.
T2 62 William_Robinson : It even showed me the Album which song it belongs to.
T2 63 William_Robinson : It was amazing.
T2 64 Eil : The future of "radio" is on the Internet, period.
T2 65 Eil : Although we'll probably never be fully free of the copyright cartel's grasp when it comes to music, the Internet levels the playing field and gives independent artists and stations equal footing and gives the listener a potentially unlimited amount of choice.
T2 66 Eil : And really, it's already happening.
T2 67 Eil : You can find sites and streams playing really good music by independent artists that meets or exceeds the quality of any professionally-produced stuff, just like open source software tends to best proprietary offerings because the creators are focused first on quality and their own idea of what's "good" instead of rushing to meet deadlines or achieve monetary gain.After all the crap that the RIAA has pulled over the last decade, I try very to find music and streams that don't fund them or their artists every time I listen to or buy a song.
T2 68 Eil : On of my favorite "stations" is scenesat.com scenesat.com.
T2 69 Eil : They play music only from demoscene artists who give their work away freely.
T2 70 Eil : If you're into electronica, you'd do well to give them a listen.
T2 71 Eil : It's not all chiptunes and rehashed trance, some of it beats the pants off the offerings of similar commercial artists.
T2 72 Eil : I'd like to see more stations like this around.
T2 73 Eil : If the RIAA and PRS aren't careful, they could start to see some real competition in the near future from musicians who do what they do not because they want a phat paycheck someday, but because they love what they do and want to share their art with anyone who cares to listen.If you know of more stations that stream independent royalty-free music, please share with the rest of us.
T2 74 Kligat : Use Virtual Audio Cable muzychenko.net or a program that records everything going through your computer, to record all the music being played, then go back and remove the ads.
T3 75 johnsie : Tree huggers won't be a happy.
T3 76 johnsie : Surely it takes more electricity to transport data around the world than it does to store it.
T3 77 johnsie : Saying that, Spotify is one of the best programs ever released, simply because of the large catalogue of music and the way it's organised.
T3 78 johnsie : I remember when the MP3 first took off people complained that it couldn't be streamed  to the standard 33.6k modem.
T3 79 johnsie : Alot of people preffered to stream using Real Audio because the file sizes were smaller.
T3 80 johnsie : The sound quality sucked though.
T3 81 johnsie : Personally, I'd prefer to be able to create playlists on the fly and that's why I think streaming is a good thing.
T3 82 johnsie : In time people will be using their phones more for data purposes and for music, so it makes sense to have applications like spotify mobile so you dont get bored of the same music all the time.
T3 83 Anonymous10 : I used too download music until I found Spotify nine months ago.
T3 84 Anonymous10 : Their database of music is impressive, it's fast and with descent sound quality.
T3 85 Anonymous10 : I never thought it would replace my .mp3 collection, but it did.
T3 86 Anonymous11 : because big media can't be trusted to archive culture.
T3 87 Anonymous12 : Another reason streaming is not the future - the return of download quotas.
T3 88 Anonymous12 : Even if there was internet everywhere, why would you waste your newly imposed quota downloading the same material over and over again?
T3 89 Panseh : Streamripper sourceforge.net is able to save the stream, and with meta data and silence detection, split it into tracks.
T3 90 Panseh : Works for mp3 and ogg streams.Or you can just run Audacity and consult a programming schedule
T3 91 Rogerborg : Then create your own music.
T3 92 Rogerborg : You don't need a license to do that yet.
T3 93 Rogerborg : Perhaps you're confusing owning a physical representation of data with owning the rights to do whatever you want with those data.
T3 94 Rogerborg : Obtaining and storing the data is trivial.
T3 95 Rogerborg : It's the rights ownership issue that's pernicious.
T3 96 IrritableBeing : They are trying to push it on us.
T3 97 IrritableBeing : Force it on us.
T3 98 IrritableBeing : Cloud Computing is not and should not be the way of the future.
T3 99 IrritableBeing : It gives the "providers" too much power.
T3 100 IrritableBeing : There has to be some balance between having our own personal digital copies of things, and "borrowing" it from the providers.
T3 101 IrritableBeing : There is clearly some kind of agenda behind the companies that push Web 2.0 concepts.
T3 102 IrritableBeing : Could it be money and power?
T3 103 IrritableBeing : Minute after minute, hour after hour.
T3 104 IrritableBeing : Web 2.0 is a corporate gangster's paradise.
T3 105 Yvanhoe : Now that seems reasonable.
T3 106 Yvanhoe : Finally !
T3 107 Yvanhoe : It is strange that these people still hold true the fiction that streaming and downloading are different things...
T3 108 Chief_Camel_Breeder : Correct.
T3 109 Chief_Camel_Breeder : And the PRS wikipedia.org is a British organization, so the deal is national rather than international.
T3 110 Anonymous13 : If you like transcoded quality, buy your streams all you want.
T3 111 Anonymous13 : The quality is very low, unless your hearing is as bad as your sight then you may not notice how bad it is.This is how it works.
T3 112 Anonymous13 : Take a mp3.
T4 113 Anonymous13 : Let's call it 128 kbps.
T4 114 Anonymous13 : Serve is up as various rate streams: 32, 64, 112, 192, 256, 320.
T4 115 Anonymous13 : All from the same 128 kbps mp3.
T4 116 Anonymous13 : That's what is done.
T4 117 Anonymous13 : And no, a 320 kbps transcoded from 128 kbps mp3 is not better, it's likely much worse:  the 128 kbps encode removed 90\% of the matrial.
T4 118 Anonymous13 : The 320 kbps transcode of that will remove another 35\%, leaving you with, if you like the math, roughly 3^ of the original material.
T4 119 Anonymous13 : And that's a 320 kbps transcode, nevermind the others.
T4 120 Anonymous14 : Eric had been driving through Pennsylvania since dusk and had crossed into Ohio about two hours ago.
T5 121 Anonymous14 : It was 2 AM and pitch black outside as he approached Columbus.
T5 122 Anonymous14 : He flicked the ash from his Marlboro Light out his cracked window and mopped a greasy swatch of orange-brown hair back across his forehead.
T5 123 Anonymous14 : He hadn't stopped to eat, drink, or relieve himself since he'd left Malvern and the strain of the road was getting to him.
T5 124 Anonymous14 : With a gulp of cold coffee and one last puff from his cigarette he shit his pants.
T5 125 Anonymous14 : ``Time to make Free Software my bitch again'', He said to himself as he rolled up the window.
T5 126 BrokenHalo : that would mean I would use 1/3-2/3 of my bandwidth per month just for background noise.
T5 127 BrokenHalo : Exactly. And if you want something better than background noise - if you want to actually hear some real music !!
T5 128 BrokenHalo : without all the flaccid bass, rolled-over treble and soggy midrange of compressed files, unless you have access to a real studio-quality soundcard, you are stuck with the CD.
T5 129 BrokenHalo : I'm beginning to worry that we now have a whole generation that has never heard music reproduced as it was intended to be, and that has no expectation of anything ever sounding better than if played through a wet sock.
T5 130 BrokenHalo : Don't get me wrong, I love my iPod, but that gets used where there is lots of ambient noise, so I'm less critical of the sound quality.
T5 131 BrokenHalo : But once you have bought your CD, you don't have to pay again and again to hear it.

T6 142 nausicaa : I still prefer physical media, like CDs, but I'm warming up to the idea of downloads legal..Now, why not have streaming AND downloading?
T6 143 nausicaa : They both serve a purpose..Take Spotify; I like having a lot of music at my fingertips, being able to try new stuff, find new stuff by pure coincidence, etc..The only black cloud on the music-sky is really the labels.. They insist on regions for music.
T6 144 nausicaa : Wait a minute.. regions? I can buy a CD from whichever country I want unless there's some embargo-crap going on, but once it's online distribution, they want to tell me what I can and cannot listen to?
T6 145 nausicaa : Hell no!I remember having various odd tracks in my playlists.. I had the theme from Psycho Soldier, The Bottlerockets - Nancy Sinatra, Kim Chi - Octopus Song, and a remix from some DJ-mixalbum of Hyo-ri's Dark Angel.. All those were removed from my view..Here's a novel idea; let anyone who wants to pay, stream and/or download, no matter where they are.

T6 151 jessejamz : 'Why do you actually need to have something downloaded on your PC?
T6 152 jessejamz : The streaming idea is really the future.
T6 153 jessejamz : So now that the industry is losing the battle of having tracks with DRM and being able to completely control their content, they are now trying to say outright that we won't even be able to OWN the music.
T6 154 jessejamz : Yeah, who really needs to own anything anyway?
T6 155 jessejamz : Ownership is so overrated.
T6 156 jessejamz : It won't be long before every song in your library, or every song you ever wanted for that matter, will be able to fit on a small portable device.
T6 157 jessejamz : What better reason to acutally own the songs.
T6 158 jessejamz : The industry is truly a crock of shit.
T6 159 selven : The one disadvantage of the pirate bay is that you need to wait hours after the release until the movie is on there, and no matter when you want to watch it you need to wait hours to download it.

T6 165 markringen : simply not going to happen.
T6 166 markringen : like subscriptions scams ala Microsoft people want to own their music they don't want to lend it.
T6 167 markringen : also in Europe the entire renting market has collapsed, and it isn't going to be re-created in a fair competitive market meaning markets where renting models work, the market is unfair and uncompetitive
T6 168 mrpacmanjel : Music companies would love to see digital downloads to disappear.
T6 169 mrpacmanjel : It's destroying thier business model and it seems they are trying a new approach.If they push the idea that digital downloads are now 'old hat' or 'not needed' and 'persuade' people that streamed music is the 'future'/'cool way' of listening to music then they can retain far more control of the format.
T6 170 mrpacmanjel : Sure lock the vendore.g.
T6 171 mrpacmanjel : radio station into a 3-year deal - when the deal expires hike up the fees and/or the record companies force vendors to stream music directly from record company controlled servers only - thus full control of music property is preserved, artificial scarcety remains and profits increased for record companies.This has already happened to the newspaper industry here in the UK.
T6 172 mrpacmanjel : A central body controls all publishing rights to newspaper articles.Of course mobile phone companies like this scenario as well.I want my music paid for to be available for MY convenience to listen to not the other way round.This stinks of serious astroturfing and a feeble attempt to change consumer's attitudes to ownership.Just say NO!Personally I would to see something like; offer a 'lossy compressed' track for very low cost or free.
T6 173 mrpacmanjel : If you really like it - buy a pristine copy of the music e.g.lossless compressed - flac the difference in sound quality is obvious.
T6 174 mrpacmanjel : Of course DRM would kill this idea.Then again record companies seem to be risk adverse or just don't get the nature of the Internet.Out-of-touch music executives looking at you Sony!
T6 175 mrpacmanjel : are hurting the music industry more than anybody else and you cannot blame pirating of music for the decline of an industry.
T6 176 mrpacmanjel : Ultimatly, pointing your finger and blaming something else is not your answer.
T6 177 mrpacmanjel : You need to take stock of your business and figure-out how can you change to meet the ever-changing state of the market.
T6 178 mrpacmanjel : If you think it should be the other way round - well you are doomed to failure - it's inevitable.There must be "internet savvy" executives out there who can do something credible and create a workable solution.
T6 179 feepness : If there was some knowledge in the industry about the future we wouldn't have the mess we have right now.Same reason we're letting the banks and the Federal Reserve solve the problem they didn't see coming and initially assured us was contained.
T6 180 sirsky : It might be just me, but it sounds like about a year ago, especially in the US, was when the price hikes for online 'radio' streaming stations was such BIG news that they were all about to be shut down.#1.
T6 181 sirsky : The RIAA didn't like it cause they didn't get their $$$.#2.
T6 182 sirsky : They lobbied to have the prices increased cause they were plain greedy, and apparently don't like people to listen to music.#3.
T6 183 sirsky : What's the difference to radio in your car?#4.
T6 184 sirsky : For me - I've had a 3G or EVDO phone capable of streaming Net Radio for years.
T6 185 sirsky : 1xRTT or Edge coverage?
T6 186 sirsky : Pick a lower-bitrate station.
T6 187 sirsky : Same music.#5.
T6 188 sirsky : Why pay $15/mo.
T6 189 sirsky : for Satellite Radio ala XM or Sirius when you can stream from your phone and plug into your car stereo?
T6 190 sirsky : Sure it might cut in and out now and again, but you're not forced to pay $$$ for your music, and no radio upgrades to "HD Radio".Especially with the advent of the iPhone, and the iPod Touch, music players with built-in WiFi, a lot of this issue goes away.
T6 191 sirsky : I can tell you there's RARELY a time I'm either 1.
T6 192 sirsky : Away from my computer.
T6 193 sirsky : 2.  Somewhere without my iPod Touch or iPhone.
T6 194 sirsky : 3.  Somewhere I'm lacking 3G/Edge coverage on my iPhone.
T6 195 sirsky : And if I am in a place like that, I turn on the ACTUAL CAR RADIO, or listen to some of the albums I've BOUGHT.
T6 196 sirsky : Wow.  Listen to the music you own, or to what other people are listening to.
T6 197 sirsky : What a concept.I think the RIAA shot themselves in the foot here, by trying to get their $$$ and forcing such a HUGE increase in royalties paid that they ended up bringing so much attention to the issue that everyone jumped on board.
T6 198 sirsky : Whoops.  How much did streaming radio stations save in advertising revenue to get listeners, when the RIAA yelling and screaming 'NO!
T6 199 sirsky : MY MONEY!'???
T6 200 sirsky : Bring that kind of national attention to yourself, and folks will flock from everywhere to see what it's all about.Downloading and owning your music is good and all - and a lot of folks have posted as such - that they want to own it.
T6 201 sirsky : Then BUY THE CD or buy the album from iTunes.
T6 202 sirsky : If you just want to listen to random music ala radio - stream it, what's your problem?Plus, you can't discover new music and new artists by listening to the same shit that you OWN over and over and over.
T6 203 sirsky : That's at least ONE thing the streaming stations provide.That, and YOU try and find me ONE real 'radio' station that everyone can tune in to that plays the same stuff as GROOVE SALAD from Soma.fm on the regular airwaves.
T6 204 sirsky : Then tell me it's not worth it.

T6 207 Anonymous19 : 1 You might not always have a network connection but still want to listen to music for example, if you are traveling or your network is down.2 You might want to take your music with you on a portable device.3 Streaming kills battery life on mobile devices, especially if embedded in flash.4 Your streaming music provider might not have, or might stop carrying, a song you really want to listen to.5 Streaming providers may not have that eclectic genre of music you like.6 You will likely have to pay subscription fees at some point, which means you keep paying for the same music over and over again.7 Streaming does not necessarily provide music at its highest quality in fact, it likely does not.
T6 208 Anonymous19 : If you want to listen to a recording at its original fidelity, streaming is a bad way to do it.8 Streaming makes you dependent on whatever technology your streaming provider chooses to use.
T6 209 Anonymous19 : If you don't want to, or can't use that technology, you are out of luck.9 You can't sell your copy of an audio stream to someone else when you no longer want it.10 Streaming often takes much more CPU than local playback for example, Pandora, which uses Flash11 Streaming often has advertisements in it, but you don't want to listen to ads or see them so you can listen to music.12 Streaming may eventually come to be dominated by companies such as clearchannel, which will provide streams that cater to the largest groups of listeners, but exclude what you really like.

T7 221 YouDoNotWantToKnow : Unless the big record company bosses come to their senses and switch to a mass distribution model ready for this century.
T7 222 YouDoNotWantToKnow : Make songs 10c and albums 2$ and see how your unit sales explode.
T7 223 YouDoNotWantToKnow : If you make music so affordable and convenient to download it beats the pirate model, just as many or close to that people who now pirate the stuff will buy it.
T7 224 PattyMc : "Industry Insiders' seems to be Steve Purdham, CEO of a music streaming service.
T7 225 PattyMc : Nice plant.
T7 226 TheRaven64 : This article is about Britain.
T7 227 TheRaven64 : Our mobile phone networks are a bit behind the rest of Europe, and a lot behind Japan, but even so most phones sold in the last few years have supported streaming music, as long as your contract provides enough bandwidth, and pre-pay phones increasingly provide cheapish data.
T7 228 TheRaven64 : My last two phones have both come with a media player that supports Internet radio stations and I generally get about 50KB/s transfers which is a lot more than you need for streaming music most streams are 8-16KB/s.
T7 229 TheRaven64 : And with ubiquitous cheap Internet?
T7 230 TheRaven64 : Most Internet Radio streams are around 128Kb/s.
T7 231 TheRaven64 : The government wants 2Mb/s broadband everywhere by 2012, so that takes care of all home and office users.
T8 232 TheRaven64 : That just leaves mobile.
T8 233 TheRaven64 : UMTS gives around 400Kb/s in real-world use, and most networks are now deploying some kind of HSPA, which gives at least five times that.
T8 234 TheRaven64 : A cheap Â£10/month mobile broadband connection gives 3GB/month, which is enough for about two hours of streaming per day.
T8 235 TheRaven64 : If you pay a bit more, you can get a lot more data; 15GB for Â£15, which is enough for 9 hours of streaming per day.
T8 236 TheRaven64 : These prices have gone down a lot in the last year, and with increased competition there's no reason to expect that they won't continue to fall.
T8 237 TheRaven64 : 15GB/month is enough for most people to stream music all of the time they're outside their house, and still have a chunk of their allowance left over.
T8 238 TheRaven64 : When the caps are closer to 30GB, or 50GB, then streaming won't even be a significant fraction of usage.
T8 239 TheRaven64 : The bigger concern is battery life.
T8 240 TheRaven64 : Playing back music via a wireless network connection uses a lot more power than reading if from flash.
T8 241 deviceb : Long before nubs found napster..
T8 242 deviceb : We have a laptop hooked right into the mixer
T8 243 deviceb : The club hooked up DSL for 2 nights
T8 244 deviceb : Were uploading the stream to our Shoutcast shoutcast.com server
T8 245 deviceb : Parties in Toronto &amp; Chicago are picking up the stream
T8 246 deviceb : by the way... there is a nice little open source app called streamripper that allows you to record the music should it be good enough.
T8 247 deviceb : So yeah... good idea recording industry stay ahead of the curve..
T8 248 Anonymous20 : Pounds were "L", shillings were next and "s" was their nominated letter.So when we said "what's the cost, pounds, shillings and pence?

T8 250 Anonymous21 : I use itunes all the time, and rip my own CDs and download the albums I own on vinyl, in total I think my library is around 140 gigs.
T8 251 Anonymous21 : Streaming as an alternative would suck because I would NEVER be able to remember all those albums and artists!
T8 252 Anonymous21 : I love to browse through the music that has taken years to accumulate and spot something I haven't heard in ages and play it.If someone deleted my iTunes library I would never be able to get it all again precisely because I would never be able to recall everything in there.Having said that, streaming services like Spotify are fantastic for their own niche.
T8 253 Anonymous21 : A lot of people I know that are maybe not as into music as some, use spotify as their sole music source and find that satisfactory.
T9 254 Anonymous21 : Then you have the great ability to just type in some artist or famous song that you wouldn't like enough to buy or even download, but want to check out.and there are the communal aspects of it, like making a playlist for a party that anyone who is invited to can add songs to.
T9 255 Anonymous21 : This is a very useful service I've used a few times to great effect.
T9 256 Anonymous22 : then I would change to all streaming.
T9 257 Anonymous22 : I think it would be great to enter an artist or album name and stream all that music or to be able to pick and to create a playlist of specific songs that I can stream to my devices.
T9 258 Anonymous22 : Until then I'll download my music and create my playlists on my iPod.
T9 259 Anonymous22 : Give me more options is what I, and it seems a lot of people, want.
T9 260 Anonymous22 : So, I'll continue to stream music to find new artists and download them to create my perfect playlist.
T9 261 aepervius : The right of copyright/redistribution is the pernicious issue.
T9 262 aepervius : The right of ownership is pretty clear.
T9 263 aepervius : once you get *sold* a CD it is yours.
T9 264 aepervius : You can hear music on any device you want, there is a fair use portion to allow you backup/transfer on other device your OWN device, and most importantly you can use the CD as frisbee, as coaster for beer, or for whatever you can think of.
T9 265 aepervius : But as soon as you want to redistribute the content, or the image / photo of the CD / Cover, you have to ask the copyright holder.
T9 266 aepervius : So yes, possession is no problem, distribution is the problem.
T9 267 Mordaximus : You'd be very unlikely to be streaming FLAC; it would take you quite a few days to reach 2G streaming at 128kbps 24 hours a day.
T9 268 Anonymous23 : Hmmm don't know, a few days ago i would have laughed at the idea.
T9 269 Anonymous23 : But just Sunday I installed last.fm on my Iphone and since then i didn't listen to my normal music...Would i pay to retain this service on a per song basis ?
T9 270 Anonymous23 : No, i wouldn't.

T9 272 Anonymous23 : Yep, as long as it isn't over 5$ ...
T9 273 Cesa : The market will adapt, more and more devices will have some kind of internet connection.
T9 274 Cesa : Personally I use my cell for all my "mobile" music listening and with Spotify coming to cells spotify.com I soon won't have any real need for music files.
T9 275 Cesa : Spotify has already cut my music file downloading legal or otherwise by at least 75\%.
T9 276 dontPanik : I remember when I used to listen to the internet radio station http://www.3wk.com/ 3wk.com.
T9 277 dontPanik : When I first started listening, they were a thriving website.
T9 278 dontPanik : There were no ads, only every now and then would they have a PSA on air telling you that you could become a subscriber, and they would have a downloads page where you could download selected songs every week.
T9 279 dontPanik : Then the fees for broadcasting over the internet skyrocketed, and the site turned into an epelectic siezure of flashing ads.
T9 280 dontPanik : Every few songs would be interupted by a Geico ad, and it wasn't the same place I grew to love.
T9 281 dontPanik : I think the companies need to understand how to deal with the internet, and know how to not choke it off, because it's here to stay.
T9 282 dontPanik : Hopefully this acceptance of music streaming will allow internet radio stations to start thriving again.
T9 283 SirGarlon : This looks to me like just the next step beyond DRM.With DRM, you possess a copy but can only use it ways the copyright holder lets you.
T9 284 SirGarlon : With this "streaming" model, you don't even possess the copy.Probably the "industry insiders" think this is a way to get people to rent music instead of buying it you pay for what you listen to, every time you listen.
T9 285 SirGarlon : Good luck with that.
T9 286 Anonymous24 : Perhaps you're confused on ownership.
T9 287 Anonymous24 : If the so called rights holder does not have the power or influence to enforce their rights, then it is no ownership at all.This is the real imaginary property.
T9 288 Helldesk_Hound : 'Why do you actually?
T9 289 Helldesk_Hound : need to have something downloaded on your PC?
T9 290 Helldesk_Hound : The streaming idea is really the future.
T9 291 Helldesk_Hound : '"Duh!If you download that file you can play it multiple times without needing to pay for any more network bandwidth.If you have to stream it to your computer you'll not only have to pay for the bandwidth each time, but you'll have to pay to listen to it each time.Streaming is only the "future" of music on the Internet if you believe that in the past you could only listen to music via the radio.
T9 292 Anonymous25 : I stream my music, alright.
T9 293 Anonymous25 : It's amazingly handy.
T9 294 Anonymous25 : The convenience of not being tied down to one computer, the fact that the music isn't taking up space on both my laptop and my desktop and so on and so forth.Trick is, though, I'm the one that has the streaming server, as represented by a Linux box with a samba share every music player plays nice with shares :PI'm not going to allow the ability to enjoy my music be constrained by my ISP's uptime.
T9 295 Anonymous25 : Given that ISPs are shifting to a payment-per-byte model, I don't want to pay for the downloading of the music that I'm listening to, times the number of times I listen to it.I think someone in the RIAA decided to take Google's "desktop-on-the-web" idea and apply it to music.
T9 296 Anonymous25 : Someone might want to mention that users aren't exactly lining up to find additional leashes to tie around their computers.
T9 297 Narls : Working from home I listen to quite a lot of music during the day/evening.
T9 298 Narls : In the one month I used Spotify heavily 5-10 albums over the course of a day I found my bandwidth usage more than doubled over prior months while all other usage remained constant.
T9 299 Narls : Unfortunately that meant I went out of the scope of my ISP's monthly data limit and my bill skyrocketed.
T9 300 Narls : As strictly anecdotal evidence I'm now hesitant of any streaming service, especially one that utilizes P2P/caching technology as Spotify claims it does.
T9 301 jlf278 : This reminds me of a nightmare I had.
T9 302 jlf278 : I was out and about looking for a bathroom and for some reason all of them required a small fee paid by credit card to use.
T9 303 jlf278 : When I got back home, I discovered my own bathroom had been outfitted with a similar payment requiring device.
T9 304 jlf278 : Is this what the world is coming to?

T9 311 hollywench : :-p   From where I am sitting, it's about control, not property rights.
T9 312 hollywench : How about because I want it on my insert name of favorite listening device here to listen to whenever *I* want, not when whoever is controlling the stream  decides I can hear it or not.
T9 313 Wireless_Joe : So make a slight correction to the headline:
T9 314 Wireless_Joe : Music Streaming and Ripping to Overtake Downlaods
T9 315 Wireless_Joe : Everyone wins, right?
T9 316 digitalaudiorock : I wouldn't worry as the conclusions are "according to industry insiders.
T9 317 digitalaudiorock : " so it is almost certainly wishful thinking rather than rigorous, peer reviewed research.Absolutely.
T9 318 digitalaudiorock : They've based their entire business model for the last twelve years on wishful thinking, which is why they're in the crapper.
T9 319 digitalaudiorock : Thier mindset is changing from "wouldn't it be nice if we could sell people digital music files they can't copy?
T9 320 digitalaudiorock : " to "wouldn't it be nice if we could sell people digital music without giving them the files at all?
T9 321 digitalaudiorock : "...and we're supposed to believe that's the wave of the future.Seriously...could these guys be bigger idiots.
T10 322 Anonymous26 : Rights, as you so offhandedly refer to the tangled web of legal gobbledy-gook we call copyright law, are nothing more than a thinly disguised net to capture money from gullible people.1 If music is played then music is heard.
T10 323 Anonymous26 : Attempts to control a who can play the music and b who can hear the music are insane.2 If music can be recorded is will be recorded.
T10 324 Anonymous26 : Attempts to control who can record the music under what conditions and what they can do with those recordings and who they can give or sell those recordings are again insane.3 The person who performs a song does not own it.
T10 325 Anonymous26 : A person who contracts with a performer does not own the song.
T11 326 Anonymous26 : A person who writes a song does not own it.
T11 327 Anonymous26 : These things are all true because a song is only a song if it is heard by someone.
T11 328 Anonymous26 : Otherwise it is jerking off in a corner.The most important part of a song is the pair of ears that hear it.
T11 329 Anonymous26 : Anyone who says differently is either stupid or trying to get a piece of the pie.
T11 330 DramaGeek : In some cases, we can do it for free WITH their hardware, too.
T11 331 DramaGeek : I had a Motorola E815 a few years ago.
T11 332 DramaGeek : Motorola designed it with a bunch of features Bluetooth OBEX, microSD usage, Dialup tethering, music player off internal memory, etc.
T11 333 DramaGeek : that Verizon disabled so that you would have to pay and use their Get It Now service.
T11 334 DramaGeek : Fortunately, it was fairly easy so seem-edit the phone, and with the USB tether for the phone and a few questionably-legal programs you could re-enable all of the features.
T11 335 DramaGeek : If you were really dedicated to the task, you could mash some of the alltel firmware in, and run Java though I never did.
T11 336 DramaGeek : I would have replaced it with another of the same model it was falling apart from wear and tear, but of course it had been replaced by the 'newest and greatest.
T11 337 DramaGeek : 'Oh, and the best part of the phone?
T11 338 DramaGeek : It DIDN'T run Verizon's OS.
T11 339 SCHecklerX : If I were an artist, I'd treat streaming as free advertising and be happy that somebody was laying down their own money for an infrastructure to get my stuff out to the masses.Oh well.
T11 340 vertinox : Sometimes, I want something to actually be MINE.Well that is the problem with having massive storage space and a extremely large music collection...You'll never be able to listen to it all much less listen to new things.I've been rather overwhelmed by my music collection lately and its all legal rips and downloads so I never can figure out what I want to listen too even on shuffle and that precludes new music.So I use Pandora to listen to music I own and find new music I don't.I've bought a bit of music simply because streaming lets me listen to it at random but sometimes I want to listen to it now so owning it helps with that.
T11 341 SCHecklerX : I use my sansa at the gym and when camping.
T11 342 SCHecklerX : A USB stick on the car while driving.But at home, I have a roku soundbridge, and guess what?
T11 343 SCHecklerX : I don't use it for anything but streaming, usually from Radio Paradise.You can have both.
T11 344 SCHecklerX : Yeah, ubiquitous internet access would mean portable devices could then stream, but until then, there are options, and I stream quite a lot when at home.
T11 345 SteeldrivingJon : Please.
T11 346 SteeldrivingJon : Might as well title this "Streaming service CEO thinks he's going to hit it big!
T11 347 H0p313ss : Clearly I have not been paying enough attention, there I was thinking that one of the causes of the demise of GM was the decline of sales of their gas guzzlers in favor of smaller more efficient vehicles...
T11 348 tepples : There are technologies built into Windows Media DRM, such as Secure Audio Path and Protected User Mode Audio, that detect and reject these "virtual cable" devices if the stream so specifies.
T11 349 tepples : You'd need to send line-out to line-in.
T11 350 Anonymous27 : I used to think these subscription streaming services were bunk too until actually tried one, Rhapsody, to be specific.
T11 351 Anonymous27 : The problems being described here like offline access have already been resolved.
T11 352 Anonymous27 : What Rhapsody does is for $xx per month you get access to their catalog to stream whenever and wherever you are, and if you want to move some of those tracks to your mp3 player which could even be an ipod you can do so, so it's really no different than if you were using iTunes to do the same thing.There's actually one major benefit to these services -- you can sample a lot of music because there's no additional cost to do so.
T11 353 Anonymous27 : With the per-track/per-album purchase model, like iTunes, you may hesitate to try new artists or albums because even at $0.99 it eventually starts adding up.It's a tradeoff -- with a streaming service you have a way larger music library than you can accumulate by purchasing, but the moment you stop paying you no longer have any music.
T11 354 Anonymous27 : For many people, I think it's actually a better choice but until you try it, it seems very foreign.
T11 355 Anonymous27 : The only reason I don't have it now is that I'm a Mac user, and with a Mac+iTunes+ipod, it's a nicely integrated system.
T11 356 Anonymous27 : If that wasn't the case though, I'd get Rhapsody instead.
T11 357 Anonymous28 : Why is this marked insightful?
T11 358 Anonymous28 : Creating specific playlists is exactly what the major streaming services allow you to do.
T11 359 Anonymous28 : They give you a giant library of music that you can create as many playlists as you want.
T11 360 Anonymous28 : Rhapsody even lets you create a small playlist for free!
T11 361 argent : Yes, with streaming we can drive the Internet to the Clear Channel Radio where you hear the same songs played over and over everywhere as quickly as possible, by reducing the charges just enough to allow advertising supported radio but not so far that it doesn't keep that independent riffraff out of the loop.
T11 362 2obvious4u : Wow, how did we all fall for that one...1.
T11 363 2obvious4u : Lower the cost to stream music to almost nothing.2.
T11 364 2obvious4u : Get more people and businesses using streaming music.3.
T11 365 2obvious4u : Jack prices back up to 0.22p4.
T11 366 2obvious4u : Profit?
T11 367 b4dc0d3r : It's the difference between Radio and buying a CD.
T11 368 b4dc0d3r : I like finding new stuff on the radio or at least I used to, when they played new stuff.
T11 369 b4dc0d3r : Then buy on CD if I like it.
T11 370 b4dc0d3r : Streaming *should* be higher usage as people look for new sounds, then download the little bit of it they like.If you only want to download things, and delete the stuff you don't like, that's fine.
T12 371 b4dc0d3r : but I'd rather not use my hdd to store and delete crap - that's what RAM is for.
T12 372 Anonymous29 : The streaming idea is really the futureSomebody needs to tell these industry "insiders" that streaming is going to get killed if the ISP's keep moving to a transfer cap/quota system.My ISP doesn't currently cap me, so it's not a big deal right now, but I see absolutely no reason why I should stream something instead of downloading it, unless it's something like a radio station or a non-stop news/weather feed.As it stands, anytime I go to a "streaming" site I either use a stream ripper to pull it down and save it before I watch it if possible, or immediately pause the thing and let it buffer up for a good amount of time before I starting watching/listening.Now, if my ISP would sell me a 100meg connection for under $50 a month, with no throttling or transfer caps, then sure I'd stream stuff with no worries- but I'd still store a fair amount of media locally to peruse at my leisure.But the consumer market is not moving towards streaming.
T12 373 Anonymous29 : Consumers have been moving AWAY from streaming since the advent of the home VCR, when people found they could just record the TV shows and fast-forward or watch at their leisure.
T12 374 Anonymous29 : This has become even more common with the advent of DVR services from cable companies.Talk about having your head up your ass, this really takes the cake.

T12 381 Todd_Knarr : To make sure you still have the music if the streaming service goes bankrupt, gets sued out of existence or adds restrictions to the availability of the material.To keep you from running up against bandwidth caps your ISP imposes.
T12 382 Todd_Knarr : It eats less bandwidth to download material once and play it multiple times from your local drive than it does to stream it every time you want to listen to it.
T12 383 Anonymous30 : In the future, GM ownership will be compulsory to receive a tax refund.
T12 384 Karganeth : Without ubiquitous, unlimited, cheap internet access that's not going to be music that's streamed.Technology, especially regarding computers, changes very quickly in today's world - much faster than 14 years ago.
T12 385 Karganeth : Mobile phones will soon eclipse mp3 players.
T12 386 Karganeth : They have a significant amount of storage on them now enough to store a very large number of songs on and they do also have another feature: internet access.
T12 387 Karganeth : Mobile phones will be the key to the success of streaming music.

T12 392 Latinhypercube : Who else could have conceived of such a brilliant idea ?
T12 393 dust4ngel : i feel that any of these conversations about the future of copyright vis a vis music is incomplete insofar as they do not touch the reliance of the music industry on an artificial scarcity which no longer exists.
T12 394 dust4ngel : music is now easy and cheap to make and distribute, and indie artists are popping up like weeds and giving their music away for free - and a lot of it is very, very good.
T12 395 dust4ngel : the industry can DRM the crap out of everything they own and make it impossible to use - it won't help them compete with an open culture in which most of the music is openly shared free of cost.
T12 396 Anonymous32 : Streaming is great for online radio, but what if you're out n about, and just want to listen to your mp3 player?
T12 397 Anonymous32 : Sound like another industry n00b with a "big idea".
T13 398 bugi : All created music is *mine*.
T13 399 bugi : I've just let my government let the creator of the music have a time-limited monopoly on commercial exploitation of it.Of course, now that the creators' agents have so thoroughly abused my magnanimity, I think it may be time to revise the time and and the extent of the monopoly downward a bit.
T13 400 GWBasic : This article is very easy to mis-interpret.
T13 401 GWBasic : Streaming isn't going to replace downloads; it's replacing terrestrial radio.
T13 402 GWBasic : The royalties are only being lowered for sites like Pandora; but "On-demand streaming services still have to pay the record labels about 1p for every track streamed.
T13 403 VoltageX : Agreed, you can pry FLACs, and my FLAC enabled copy of lame.exe from my cold, dead hands.
T13 404 Anonymous33 : Possession is nine tenths of the law, buddy.
T13 405 Anonymous33 : It is so easy and costless to get, use and distribute data these days that any politician who wants to use a cumbersome and wasteful institution like the legal system to create a distribution monopoly for a certain work needs to go back to college and retake economics 101.
T13 406 Narcogen : This is complete and utter unsubstantiated nonsense.
T14 407 Narcogen : The reason why the purchase model has so far done better than either the subscription or streaming models is because the user gets something concrete-- even if it is just a file-- that they can feel is theirs.
T14 408 Narcogen : The barrier to streaming being the dominant method is not pricing.
T14 409 Narcogen : After all, radio is essentially streaming and it was ad-supported and free.
T14 410 Narcogen : Free ad-supported streaming and ubiquitous broadband might kill radio, but it won't kill the iTMS or its business model.This is a bit of self-interested claptrap from someone with a vested interest in seeing their prediction come true.
