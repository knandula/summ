T1 1 timothy : An anonymous reader writes "A Turkish hacking ring has broken into 2 sensitive US Army servers, according to a new investigation uncovered by InformationWeek.
T1 2 timothy : The hackers, who go by the name 'm0sted' and are based in Turkey, penetrated servers at the Army's McAlester Ammunition Plant in Oklahoma in January.
T1 3 timothy : Users attempting to access the site were redirected to a page featuring a climate-change protest.
T1 4 timothy : In Sept, 2007, the hackers breached Army Corps of Engineers servers.
T1 5 timothy : That hack sent users to a page containing anti-American and anti-Israeli rhetoric.
T2 6 timothy : The hackers used simple SQL Server injection techniques to gain access.
T2 7 timothy : That's troubling because it shows a major Army security lapse, and also the ability to bypass supposedly sophisticated Defense Department tools and procedures designed to prevent such breaches.
T2 8 Anonymous1 : when you are busy trying to defend against the most advanced crackers around, and whatever complex tools they are using, its probably easy to overlook the simpler stuff
T2 9 dkleinsc : as usual, military contracting companies provided over-hyped shoddy work to the military, who either didn't know better or didn't care.Of course, I thought it was going to be as simple as knowing that the password was "Joshua".
T2 10 Anonymous2 : All your base are belong to us
T2 11 avandesande : That's troubling because it shows a major Army security lapse, and also the ability to bypass supposedly sophisticated Defense Department tools and procedures designed to prevent such breaches.Who know where these outward facing servers reside?
T2 12 avandesande : Having outward websites vandalized says nothing about the security of an organizations networks.
T2 13 TheSpoom : The US Army uses Windows servers?
T2 14 Anonymous3 : If they want to prove a point they have to stop targeting US Defense facilities.
T2 15 Anonymous3 : Hack a serious portal like Slashdot if you can!
T2 16 Anonymous3 : Ha!
T2 17 Anonymous4 : A lot of defense spending is basically taxpayers helping out some overpaid well-connected idiots.
T2 18 Anonymous5 : Pardon the rant, but can anyone tell me why we're still having people write code that is subject to SQL injection attacks?I mean, sometimes potential buffer overflows in C/C++ programs can be tricky to notice.
T2 19 Anonymous5 : Writing threading code that's not subject to deadlock or starvation can often be a challenge.But isn't code that's subject to SQL injection attacks just blindingly, amazingly obvious at first glance?
T2 20 Anonymous6 : So much for Information Week being reasoned and sensible.
T2 21 Anonymous6 : "Equally troubling is the fact that the hacks appear to have originated outside the United States.
T2 22 Anonymous6 : Turkey is known to harbor significant elements of the al-Qaida network.
T2 23 Anonymous6 : It was not clear if "m0sted" has links to the terrorist group.
T2 24 Anonymous6 : " Hooray for sensationalism!
T2 25 Manip : I'm just playing devil's advocate but who puts their public website inside their defences?I know it is an extremely common practice in this country to actually put sites like these on standard third party hosting services e.g.
T2 26 Manip : Rackspace.They set them up to be as secure as other e-commerce sites, so fairly secure, but without having to poke holes in a nice heavy firewall.
T2 27 Anonymous7 : I didn't bother to RTFA, but summary is inflamatory at best.A public-facing, high-profile perception server gets compromised?
T2 28 Anonymous7 : That's not news.Let's say it is news for a minute.
T2 29 Anonymous7 : What was the budget for this public-facing project?
T2 30 Anonymous7 : This is not a "major Army security lapse" by any stretch of the imagination.Of course, my line of thinking wouldn't be widely accepted because it ignores the emotional response that the summary probably provokes in most people.
T2 31 Anonymous8 : A chain is not stronger than it's weakest link.A simple and powerful principle when dealing with security, whatever side of the law or order you are.
T3 32 Anonymous9 : 1. good tactics2.
T3 33 Anonymous9 : the ability to adapt new tactics as previously good tactics become irrelevantone way a tactic becomes irrelevant is changing battlefield conditions.

T3 39 TheRealMindChild : This is what you get when you recruit kids out of high school and renege on the promise of the money they will get for joining up.
T3 40 TheRealMindChild : It is communism-on-a-stick.
T3 41 TheRealMindChild : Where is the motivation to do well
T3 42 Anonymous10 : I think using SQL injection hasn't qualified as "hacking" since it showed up on XKCD.
T3 43 Lord_Ender : How do you know the code was recently written?
T3 44 Lord_Ender : More likely, the app was written years ago, before the phrase "sql injection" was even coined.
T3 45 Anonymous11 : Um...no.If they had managed to get passed a single firewall or router, I would be impressed.
T3 46 Anonymous11 : As it stands, they redirected links on a public facing webserver...yawn.

T4 52 cdrguru : The US military is pretty much incapable of fighting a guerrilla war where the combatents are intermixed with civilians and civilian casualties are forbidden.
T4 53 cdrguru : It made Vietnam very difficult and it has made Iraq difficult as well.What we have is a guerrilla war against hackers where they are effectiely shielded in most cases by the ISP and their own country's law enforcement.
T4 54 cdrguru : The end result is almost an unwinnable war.We are winning in Iraq by ending the use of civilians as shields.
T4 55 cdrguru : We won in Vietnam by separating the combatants from the civilians.
T4 56 cdrguru : It is going to take that sort of effort to win against hackers, crackers and identity thieves.
T4 57 cdrguru : Unfortunately, right now the effort required to do this is intense enough that it is many, many times the losses so far.
T4 58 cdrguru : So I don't think they are going to do anything until the losses mount up a lot more.What makes this worse is in order to effectively combat these people it is going to take either the cooperation of foreign law enforcement or just going around them.
T4 59 cdrguru : Neither one is going to make these other countries want to be our friends, but they seem to be happy with the hackers running around doing whatever.
T4 60 senorpoco : Start by protecting against the simple stuff and work up.
T4 61 iPhr0stByt3 : Oh no, they redirected web users.
T4 62 iPhr0stByt3 : My goodness, does this mean we'll see missles flying overhead soon?
T4 63 iPhr0stByt3 : Seriously, every department in the world has trojans in some form "inside the network".
T4 64 iPhr0stByt3 : But retrieving the secretaries mail and retrieving classified information are different things.
T4 65 iPhr0stByt3 : Albeit, redirecting users IS a mediocre risk, but since when does /.
T4 66 iPhr0stByt3 : care about mediocre over-hyped news?
T4 67 stuntpope : It appears the servers in question were used for serving up web sites.
T4 68 stuntpope : Probably publicly-facing web sites.
T4 69 stuntpope : So, what sensitive information was at risk?
T4 70 stuntpope : There are already regulations about what content can be approved to sit on a DoD server with a publicly-facing web site.

T4 100 jeff4747 : As mentioned by other posters, since we don't know how old the system is, we can't really measure it against "modern" perceptions.In addition, they could be a victim of this kind of thing: Contractor:  We'd like to make a prototype for a web site that will do XYZ.
T4 101 jeff4747 : Govt: K, here's some cash.
T4 102 jeff4747 : Contractor:  Here's a prototype, now can we have some cash to convert it from a prototype into a real system?
T4 103 jeff4747 : Govt: Nah.
T4 104 jeff4747 : I'd have to fill out a lot of paperwork for that.
T4 105 jeff4747 : We'll just use the prototype.
T4 106 jeff4747 : ?Who says it's behind their real defenses?Look, it's a web server on the Internet.
T4 107 jeff4747 : It's gonna need at least a firewall.
T4 108 jeff4747 : Just like if they used Rackspace to host it and you were behind Rackspace's firewall.
T4 109 jeff4747 : But there's also gonna be additional defenses for other systems.And, btw, anything that's on the server is gonna be unclassified or somebody's goin' to jail regardless of the breach.
T4 110 ultranova : What you have is a few teenagers writing graffiti on the army bulletin board located outside the base.
T4 111 ultranova : And yes, the War on Vandals is likely unwinnable.
T4 112 ultranova : However, you might try declaring War on Exaggeration.We won in Vietnam by separating the combatants from the civilians.
T4 113 ultranova : You didn't win in Vietnam, you lost and fled.
T4 114 jeff4747 : Not really.
T4 115 jeff4747 : Do you have any idea just how many computers have .mil addresses?
T4 116 jeff4747 : If somebody screwed up on the configuration for an infinitesimally small percentage of them, that's still a lot of systems open to attack.
T4 117 jeff4747 : And the script kiddies will get lucky.But the US military also doesn't talk about their own "cyber" offensive and defensive capabilities for obvious reasons.
T4 118 jeff4747 : Which leads to the erroneous presumption that such capabilities don't exist.Besides, these kinds of stories are great for getting additional funding for somebody's pet project.
T4 119 jeff4747 : Much like Kennedy's complaining about the "Missile Gap" when he beat Nixon.

T6 163 dbIII : the Trojan horse lets the other nasty stuff in.
T6 164 dbIII : Forget the "guerrilla war against hackers" bullshit since the people we really want to catch are fraudsters, money launderers and the occassional trespasser onto military networks which makes them a spy and not some "cyberterrorist".
T6 165 dbIII : When we escalate the words into the realm of fantasy you end up with pointless running around in circles trying to catch fantastic supervillians that may not exist instead of looking at reality and catching those that do exist.
T7 166 nametaken : Seems we don't have to know much about the situation to know one thing... a "major Army security lapse" is more like, say, strategic radio comm in the clear, close enough to be intercepted by the enemy, and results in casualties.A public facing website that gets script-kiddied by some asshat from Turkey that thinks exploiting a site by SQL injection is Uber-L33t is not a major lapse.

T7 171 mjwx : There hasn't been any noticeable decrease in violence, just less reporting of it.
T7 172 mjwx : Just because the US army has the media on a tight leash doesn't mean that you're winning, in fact this is about the only lesson the US armed forces learned in Vietnam and in my opinion the most useless one taught.We won in Vietnam
T7 173 mjwx : Ahh yes, we've all seen the famous "victory in Vietnam" photo.
T8 174 mjwx : You know the one where all the people are rushing to the roof of the US embassy to get on the last chopper out of Saigon.by separating the combatants from the civilians.
T8 175 mjwx : Once again, you did no such thing.
T8 176 mjwx : The US didnt know about half the double agents inside the South Vietnamese government and army until after the NVA rocked up in Saigon and pat them on the back.

T9 234 josephcmiller2 : This way, you can look at any SQL code I've written and instantly know if it's secure or not.
T9 235 josephcmiller2 : I would call this code "obviously secure" at least the SQL part is.
T9 236 josephcmiller2 : It may still contain bugs, but SQL injection won't be possible.
T9 237 josephcmiller2 : I've seen several other safety mechanisms that escape any variables before sending them to SQL-related functions, but looking inside the function instead of the caller you really don't know what data you have and whether it is safe or not.
T9 238 josephcmiller2 : I think secure code should be obviously secure.
T9 239 josephcmiller2 : Of course there are those buffer overflow problems and threading etc like you mention, but how about quit using sprintf and instead use snprintf?

T9 245 josephcmiller2 : If your code isn't obviously secure, I argue that it's not secure.
T9 246 josephcmiller2 : Especially if you aren't the only developer in the pipeline.
T9 247 josephcmiller2 : We all organize this code differently in our own heads and what makes sense to one dev is confusing to another.
